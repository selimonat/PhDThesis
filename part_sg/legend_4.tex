\textbf{EEG Waveforms Lock to Visual Input at Multiple Sites.} \textbf{(A)} Headplots show the
topographic distribution of the grand average correlation coefficients
between ERP waveform (averaged over bimodal congruent and incongruent and
unimodal visual conditions) and visual stimulus speed at selected time lags
between 0 and 400 ms. Correlation magnitude is color coded as in Fig.
\ref{xcorrpower}. \textbf{(B)} Condition comparison for electrodes OZ
(upper panel) and CPZ (lower panel). Waveform analysis correlograms for
bimodal congruent (BC, green line), bimodal incongruent (BI, red) and
unimodal visual (UV, dashed blue) are shown with time lags on the x- and
correlation coefficients on the y-axis. Time lags showing significant
differences between bimodal incongruent and bimodal congruent conditions
are highlighted in light gray for p\textless0.05 and darker gray for
p\textless0.01
