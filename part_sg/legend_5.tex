\textbf{No Stimulus Locking to Auditory Input.} Exemplary unimodal auditory results
are depicted for electrode CZ. \textbf{(A)} Spectrotemporal analysis
cross-correlograms are shown in rows for individual frequency bands
(y-axis). Colours represent correlation coefficients. \textbf{(B)} The waveform
analysis cross-correlation is represented with time lags on the x- and
correlation coefficients on the y-axis
