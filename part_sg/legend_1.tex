\textbf{Schematic diagram of both experimental paradigms.} For both paradigms trial
onset was self-paced, and subjects indicated their readiness by button
press. Each trial began after a random delay with the appearance of a red
fixation cross, which subjects were asked to fixate until the end of the
trial. \textbf{(a)} Bimodal trials consisted of simultaneously presented
visual and auditory stimuli, and were either congruent (stimuli followed
the same trajectory) or incongruent (different trajectories). \textbf{(b)}
Single modality trials contained two sequentially presented stimuli,
separated by a random interval (500 -1500 ms). A pair could entail stimuli
from one or both modalities, again either congruent or incongruent. After
stimulus presentation, subjects were required to decide whether the trial
was congruent or incongruent, answering via button press.
