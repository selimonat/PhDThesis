\textbf{Stimulus Locking of EEG Power to Visual Stimuli.} \textbf{(A)} Each plot shows the
topographic distribution of the grand average of the spectrotemporal
analysis correlation results (averaged over bimodal congruent, incongruent
and unimodal visual conditions and over all subjects) within the 20-35 Hz
band, at selected time lags beginning at 0 ms and ending at 200 ms lag.
Dots represent locations of labelled electrodes, with locations below head
centre drawn outside the cartoon head. Colour codes for the magnitude of
the correlation coefficient, with warm colors indicating positive and cold
colors negative correlation, and values are linearly interpolated between
recording sites for visualisation purposes. \textbf{(B)} Grand average
spectrotemporal analysis correlograms (as in a) for individual frequencies
are shown for electrode OZ. Each row represents the results for a single
frequency, with frequencies given on the y-axis and correlation lags on the
x-axis. Colour codes for magnitude of correlation coefficient
