\textbf{Temporal Progression of Stimulus Locking.} \textbf{(A)} Each row shows one grand
average waveform analysis cross-correlogram (waveforms calculated from
average of bimodal congruent and incongruent and unimodal visual
conditions), which was computed within a 500 ms shifting time window with
250 ms overlap. From bottom to top, the window is shifted from stimulus
onset to the end of stimulus presentation. Correlation coefficients are
color-coded. \textbf{(B)} The maximum waveform analysis correlation
coefficients (y-axis) are plotted as a function of time for OZ (left panel)
and CPZ (right panel). Peaks were determined within a region of interest
(0-250 ms lag) for each time window from the grand average of each
condition. The resulting data points are shown in light-colored lines for
bimodal congruent (BC, green), bimodal incongruent (BI, red) and unimodal
visual (UV, dashed blue). The according linear fits for each condition are
shown in darker thick lines in the corresponding color scheme. Stars at
line ends indicate significant linear trends (p\textless0.05) within a
condition, and starred brackets indicate significantly different slopes
between two conditions
