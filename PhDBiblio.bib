	Abstract = {A 2.91-billion base pair (bp) consensus sequence of the euchromatic portion of the human genome was generated by the whole-genome shotgun sequencing method. The 14.8-billion bp DNA sequence was generated over 9 months from 27,271,853 high-quality sequence reads (5.11-fold coverage of the genome) from both ends of plasmid clones made from the DNA of five individuals. Two assembly strategies-a whole-genome assembly and a regional chromosome assembly-were used, each combining sequence data from Celera and the publicly funded genome effort. The public data were shredded into 550-bp segments to create a 2.9-fold coverage of those genome regions that had been sequenced, without including biases inherent in the cloning and assembly procedure used by the publicly funded group. This brought the effective coverage in the assemblies to eightfold, reducing the number and size of gaps in the final assembly over what would be obtained with 5.11-fold coverage. The two assembly strategies yielded very similar results that largely agree with independent mapping data. The assemblies effectively cover the euchromatic regions of the human chromosomes. More than 90% of the genome is in scaffold assemblies of 100,000 bp or more, and 25% of the genome is in scaffolds of 10 million bp or larger. Analysis of the genome sequence revealed 26,588 protein-encoding transcripts for which there was strong corroborating evidence and an additional approximately 12,000 computationally derived genes with mouse matches or other weak supporting evidence. Although gene-dense clusters are obvious, almost half the genes are dispersed in low G+C sequence separated by large tracts of apparently noncoding sequence. Only 1.1% of the genome is spanned by exons, whereas 24% is in introns, with 75% of the genome being intergenic DNA. Duplications of segmental blocks, ranging in size up to chromosomal lengths, are abundant throughout the genome and reveal a complex evolutionary history. Comparative genomic analysis indicates vertebrate expansions of genes associated with neuronal function, with tissue-specific developmental regulation, and with the hemostasis and immune systems. DNA sequence comparisons between the consensus sequence and publicly funded genome data provided locations of 2.1 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A random pair of human haploid genomes differed at a rate of 1 bp per 1250 on average, but there was marked heterogeneity in the level of polymorphism across the genome. Less than 1% of all SNPs resulted in variation in proteins, but the task of determining which SNPs have functional consequences remains an open challenge.},

	Abstract = {THE HUMAN BRAIN HAS OFTEN BEEN VIEWED AS OUTSTANDING AMONG MAMMALIAN BRAINS: the most cognitively able, the largest-than-expected from body size, endowed with an overdeveloped cerebral cortex that represents over 80% of brain mass, and purportedly containing 100 billion neurons and 10x more glial cells. Such uniqueness was seemingly necessary to justify the superior cognitive abilities of humans over larger-brained mammals such as elephants and whales. However, our recent studies using a novel method to determine the cellular composition of the brain of humans and other primates as well as of rodents and insectivores show that, since different cellular scaling rules apply to the brains within these orders, brain size can no longer be considered a proxy for the number of neurons in the brain. These studies also showed that the human brain is not exceptional in its cellular composition, as it was found to contain as many neuronal and non-neuronal cells as would be expected of a primate brain of its size. Additionally, the so-called overdeveloped human cerebral cortex holds only 19% of all brain neurons, a fraction that is similar to that found in other mammals. In what regards absolute numbers of neurons, however, the human brain does have two advantages compared to other mammalian brains: compared to rodents, and probably to whales and elephants as well, it is built according to the very economical, space-saving scaling rules that apply to other primates; and, among economically built primate brains, it is the largest, hence containing the most neurons. These findings argue in favor of a view of cognitive abilities that is centered on absolute numbers of neurons, rather than on body size or encephalization, and call for a re-examination of several concepts related to the exceptionality of the human brain.},

@article{rolls2003a,
	Abstract = {Inferior temporal cortex neurons have generally been found to have large visual receptive fields that typically include the fovea and extend throughout much of the visual field. However, a problem of such a large receptive field is that it does not easily support object selection by subsequent processing areas, in that all objects within such a large receptive field might activate inferior temporal cortex cells. To clarify this, we recorded from inferior temporal cortex neurons while macaques searched for objects in complex natural scenes or in plain backgrounds, as normally used. Inferior temporal cortex neuron receptive fields were much smaller in natural scenes (mean radius, 11 degrees) than in plain backgrounds (39 degrees). With two objects in a scene, one of which was a target for action (a touch), the firing rates were equally high during foveation of the effective stimulus when it was the target and when it was the distractor in both the plain and the complex scenes. With a plain background and two objects present, the receptive fields were much larger (24 degrees ) for the stimulus when it was the target than when it was the distractor (9 degrees ). This effect of object-based attention was much less evident in the complex scene, when the receptive fields were small both when the stimulus was a distractor and when it was a target. The results show that the temporal visual cortex provides an unambiguous representation in natural scenes by responding to the object shown at or close to the fixation point.},

@article{einhauser2005a,
	Abstract = {Invariant object recognition is arguably one of the major challenges for contemporary machine vision systems. In contrast, the mammalian visual system performs this task virtually effortlessly. How can we exploit our knowledge on the biological system to improve artificial systems? Our understanding of the mammalian early visual system has been augmented by the discovery that general coding principles could explain many aspects of neuronal response properties. How can such schemes be transferred to system level performance? In the present study we train cells on a particular variant of the general principle of temporal coherence, the "stability" objective. These cells are trained on unlabeled real-world images without a teaching signal. We show that after training, the cells form a representation that is largely independent of the viewpoint from which the stimulus is looked at. This finding includes generalization to previously unseen viewpoints. The achieved representation is better suited for view-point invariant object classification than the cells' input patterns. This property to facilitate view-point invariant classification is maintained even if training and classification take place in the presence of an--also unlabeled--distractor object. In summary, here we show that unsupervised learning using a general coding principle facilitates the classification of real-world objects, that are not segmented from the background and undergo complex, non-isomorphic, transformations.},

@article{dehay1988a,
	Abstract = {We have examined the anatomical features of ipsilateral transient cortical projections to areas 17, 18, and 19 in the kitten with the use of axonal tracers Fast Blue and WGA-HRP. Injections of tracers in any of the three primary visual areas led to retrograde labeling in frontal, parietal, and temporal cortices. Retrogradely labeled cells were not randomly distributed, but instead occurred preferentially at certain loci. The pattern of retrograde labeling was not influenced by the area injected. The main locus of transiently projecting neurons was an isolated region in the ectosylvian gyrus, probably corresponding to auditory area A1. Other groups of transiently projecting neurons had more variable locations in the frontoparietal cortex. The laminar distribution of neurons sending a transient projection to the visual cortex is characteristic and different from that of parent neurons of other cortical pathways at the same age. In the frontoparietal cortex, transiently projecting neurons were located mainly in layer 1 and the upper part of layers 2 and 3. In the ectosylvian gyrus, nearly all the neurons are located in layers 2 and 3. In addition, a few transiently projecting neurons are found in layer 6 and in the white matter. Transiently projecting neurons have a pyramidal morphology except for the occasional spindle-shaped cell of layer 1 and multipolar cells observed in the white matter. Anterograde studies were used to investigate the location of transient fibers in the visual cortex. Injections of WGA-HRP at the site of origin of transient projections gave rise to few retrogradely labeled cells in areas 17, 18, and 19, demonstrating that transient projections to these areas are not reciprocal. Although labeled axons were found over a wide area of the posterior cortex, they were more numerous over certain regions, including areas 17, 18, and 19, and absent from other more lateral cortical regions. Transient projecting fibers were present in all cortical layers at birth. Plotting the location of transient fibers in numerous sections and at all ages showed that these fibers are not more plentiful in the white matter than they are in the gray matter. We found no evidence that the white/gray matter border constituted a physical barrier to the growth of transient axons. Comparison of the organization of this transient pathway to that of other transient connections is discussed with respect to the development of the cortex.},

	Abstract = {The spatiotemporal dynamics of the sensory response in layer 2/3 of primary somatosensory cortex evoked by a single brief whisker deflection was investigated by simultaneous voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) imaging and whole-cell (WC) voltage recordings in the anesthetized rat combined with reconstructions of dendritic and axonal arbors of L2/3 pyramids. Single and dual WC recordings from pyramidal cells indicated a strong correlation between the local VSD population response and the simultaneously measured subthreshold postsynaptic potential changes in both amplitude and time course. The earliest VSD response was detected 10-12 msec after whisker deflection centered above the barrel isomorphic to the stimulated principal whisker. It was restricted horizontally to the size of a single barrel-column coextensive with the dendritic arbor of barrel-column-related pyramids in L2/3. The horizontal spread of excitation remained confined to a single barrel-column with weak whisker deflection. With intermediate deflections, excitation spread into adjacent barrel-columns, propagating twofold more rapidly along the rows of the barrel field than across the arcs, consistent with the preferred axonal arborizations in L2/3 of reconstructed pyramidal neurons. Finally, larger whisker deflections evoked excitation spreading over the entire barrel field within approximately 50 msec before subsiding over the next approximately 250 msec. Thus the subthreshold cortical map representing a whisker deflection is dynamic on the millisecond time scale and strongly depends on stimulus strength. The sequential spatiotemporal activation of the excitatory neuronal network in L2/3 by a simple sensory stimulus can thus be accounted for primarily by the columnar restriction of L4 to L2/3 excitatory connections and the axonal field of barrel-related pyramids.},

	Abstract = {It is not known whether the variability of neural activity in the cerebral cortex carries information or reflects noisy underlying mechanisms. In an examination of the reliability of spike generation using recordings from neurons in rat neocortical slices, the precision of spike timing was found to depend on stimulus transients. Constant stimuli led to imprecise spike trains, whereas stimuli with fluctuations resembling synaptic activity produced spike trains with timing reproducible to less than 1 millisecond. These data suggest a low intrinsic noise level in spike generation, which could allow cortical neurons to accurately transform synaptic input into spike sequences, supporting a possible role for spike timing in the processing of cortical information by the neocortex.},

	Abstract = {Excitatory lateral connections within the primary visual cortex are thought to link neurons with similar receptive field properties. Here we studied whether this rule can predict the distribution of excitatory connections in relation to cortical location and orientation preference in the cat visual cortex. To this end, we obtained orientation maps of areas 17 or 18 using optical imaging and injected anatomical tracers into these regions. The distribution of labeled axonal boutons originating from large populations of excitatory neurons was then analyzed and compared with that of individual pyramidal or spiny stellate cells. We demonstrate that the connection patterns of populations of nearby neurons can be reasonably predicted by Gaussian and von Mises distributions as a function of cortical location and orientation, respectively. The connections were best described by superposition of two components: a spatially extended, orientation-specific and a local, orientation-invariant component. We then fitted the same model to the connections of single cells. The composite pattern of nine excitatory neurons (obtained from seven different animals) was consistent with the assumptions of the model. However, model fits to single cell axonal connections were often poorer and their estimated spatial and orientation tuning functions were highly variable. We conclude that the intrinsic excitatory network is biased to similar cortical locations and orientations but it is composed of neurons showing significant deviations from the population connectivity rule.},

@article{malach1993a,
	Abstract = {In primate primary visual cortex, neurons sharing similar response properties are clustered together forming functional domains that appear as a mosaic of patches or bands, often traversing the entire cortical depth from the pia to the white matter. Similarly, each cortical site connects laterally through an extensive network of intrinsic projections that are organized in multiple clusters (patches) and reach distances of up to a few millimeters. The relationship between the functional domains and these laterally connected patches has remained a controversial issue despite intensive research efforts. To investigate this relationship, we obtained high-resolution functional maps of the cortical architecture by in vivo optical imaging. Subsequently, extracellular injections of the sensitive anterograde tracer biocytin were targeted into selected functional domains. Within the ocular dominance system, we found that long-range intrinsic connections tended to link the monocular regions of same-eye ocular dominance columns. Furthermore, we discovered that binocular domains formed a separate set of connections in area V1; binocular regions were selectively connected among themselves but were not connected to strictly monocular regions, suggesting that they constitute a distinct columnar system. In the other subsystem subserving orientation preference, patches of intrinsic connections tended to link domains sharing similar orientation preferences. Analyses of the precision of these connections indicated that in both functional subsystems, < 15% of the connections were between domains having orthogonal response properties. However, their selectivity was limited; approximately 30% +/- 10% of the interconnected patches contained neurons exhibiting orientation tuning that differed from those found at the injection sites by at least 45 degrees. At short range (up to 400 microns from the injection site), this casual trend seemed markedly accentuated; the local, synaptic-rich axonal and dendritic arbors crossed freely through columns of diverse functional properties. These complex sets of connections can endow cortical neurons with a rich diversity of response properties and broad tuning.},

@article{levay1985a,
	Abstract = {Ocular dominance stripes in the striate cortex of a macaque monkey were labeled by autoradiography after injection of [3H]proline into one eye. The stripes were reconstructed on a representation of the flattened cortical surface by two independent techniques: one used computer graphics, and the other was the manual unfolding procedure of Van Essen and Maunsell (VanEssen, D. C., and J. H. R. Maunsell (1980) J. Comp. Neurol. 191: 255-281). The two reconstructions differed in many details of the pattern but were in agreement on its general features. As described in earlier studies, the stripes formed a system of parallel bands, with numerous branches and islands. They were roughly orthogonal to the V1/V2 border throughout the binocular segment of the cortex. In the lateral part of the operculum, where the fovea is represented, the stripes were less orderly than elsewhere. In the calcarine fissure the stripes ran directly across the striate cortex from its dorsal to its ventral margin. In the far periphery the stripes for the ipsilateral eye became progressively narrower, eventually fragmenting into small islands at the edge of the monocular segment. The overall periodicity (width of a left- plus right-eye pair of stripes) averaged 0.88 mm but decreased by a factor of about 2 from center to periphery. This decrease was not accounted for solely by shrinkage of the ipsilateral eye stripes. The flattened cortical reconstruction was transformed back into visual field coordinates, using information about visual field topography obtained from the detailed mapping study of Van Essen et al. (Van Essen, D.C., W.T. Newsome, and J.H.R. Maunsell (1984) Vision Res. 24: 429-448), as well as from more limited mapping done in the same monkey that was used for the reconstruction. In the transformed map, the stripes increased in width about 40-fold from the fovea to the far periphery. As deduced previously (LeVay, S., D. H. Hubel, and T. N. Wiesel (1975) J. Comp. Neurol. 159: 559-576; Hubel, D. H., and D. C., Freeman (1977) Brain Res. 122: 336-343), there were portions of the map in which the stripes followed curves approximating isoeccentricity lines, but this relationship was not very exact or consistent. The pattern of stripes appears to be more meaningfully related to the geometry of the cortical surface. This has significant implications for understanding the developmental mechanisms involved in stripe formation.},

	Abstract = {Spatiotemporal patterning of neural activity is thought to influence the development of connections in the visual pathway. This patterning can arise spontaneously or through sensory experience. Here, we use a combination of natural and simple stimuli to investigate which elements of the visual environment modulate the earliest responses in the primary visual pathway of developing ferrets. Recordings were made during the first 2 weeks of visual responsiveness, which, in the ferret, overlaps with the period that the eyelids have not yet opened. Even when the eyelids are closed, both thalamic and cortical activity was found to be temporally modulated under conditions of natural visual stimulation. The modulations correlated with temporal changes in stimulus contrast but also reflected spatial structure in the visual scene. Simple stimuli were used to show that early responses to naturalistic stimuli are influenced by the localization and structure of through-the-eyelid receptive fields. The early visual responses were also characterized by substantial variability in the ability of the cells to detect stimuli of different duration and different intensity, in a temporally precise manner. These temporal and spatial properties should constrain how plasticity mechanisms interpret naturally patterned activity.},

	Abstract = {When observers are asked to remember the final location of an object undergoing apparent or implied motion, a forward displacement is observed. The magnitude of this form of motion extrapolation is known to depend on various factors including stimulus attributes, action plans, and other cognitive cues. Here we present a modelling approach that aims at bridging different existing theories of displacement within a single theoretical framework. A network model consisting of interacting excitatory and inhibitory cell populations coding for stimulus attributes like position or orientation is used to study the response to motion displays. The intrinsic network dynamics can be modulated by additional information sources representing action plans directed at the moving target or cognitive cues such as prior knowledge about the trajectory. These factors decide the extent to which the dynamic representation overshoots the final position. The model predictions are quantitatively compared with the experimental findings. The results are discussed in relation to theoretical ideas about processing principles underlying motion extrapolation and a comparison with neurophysiological findings linked to movement prediction is made.},

@article{polat1998c,
	Abstract = {Neurons in the primary visual cortex are selective for the size, orientation and direction of motion of patterns falling within a restricted region of visual space known as the receptive field. The response to stimuli presented within the receptive field can be facilitated or suppressed by other stimuli falling outside the receptive field which, when presented in isolation, fail to activate the cell. Whether this interaction is facilitative or suppressive depends on the relative orientation of pattern elements inside and outside the receptive field. Here we show that neuronal facilitation preferentially occurs when a near-threshold stimulus inside the receptive field is flanked by higher-contrast, collinear elements located in surrounding regions of visual space. Collinear flanks and orthogonally oriented flanks, however, both act to reduce the response to high-contrast stimuli presented within the receptive field. The observed pattern of facilitation and suppression may be the cellular basis for the observation in humans that the detectability of an oriented pattern is enhanced by collinear flanking elements. Modulation of neuronal responses by stimuli falling outside their receptive fields may thus represent an early neural mechanism for encoding objects and enhancing their perceptual saliency.},

@article{lesica2005a,
	Abstract = {Traditional approaches to characterizing the transformation from stimulus to response in sensory systems assume both stationarity of the stimulus and time-invariance of the stimulus/response mapping. However, recent studies of sensory function under natural stimulus conditions have demonstrated important features of neural encoding that are in violation of these assumptions. Many sensory neurons respond to changes in the statistical distribution of the stimulus that are characteristic of the natural environment with corresponding changes in their encoding properties. In this paper, an extended recursive least-squares (ERLS) approach to adaptive estimation from stimulus/response observations is detailed. The ERLS approach improves the tracking ability of standard RLS approaches to adaptive estimation by removing a number of assumptions about the underlying system and the stimulus environment. The ERLS framework also incorporates an adaptive learning rate, so that prior knowledge of the relationship between the stimulus and the adaptive nature of the system under investigation can be used to improve tracking performance. Simulated and experimental neural responses are used to demonstrate the ability of the ERLS approach to track adaptation of encoding properties during a single stimulus/response trial. The ERLS framework lends tremendous flexibility to experimental design, facilitating the investigation of sensory function under naturalistic stimulus conditions.},

	Abstract = {The basic laminar organization of excitatory local circuitry in the primary visual cortex of the macaque monkey is similar to that described previously in the cat's visual cortex (Gilbert 1983). This circuitry is described here in the context of a two-level model that distinguishes between feedforward and feedback connections. Embedded within this basic framework is a more complex organization. Within the strictly feedforward pathway, these circuits distribute unique combinations of magno-, parvo-, and koniocellular input from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) to neurons in layers 2-4B. Their input is dependent on the extrastriate cortical areas they target. The local feedback connections from deep layers (5 and 6) arise from a diverse population of pyramidal neurons. Each type forms local connections with a unique relationship to more superficial layers. In the case of layer 6 neurons, these connections are closely related to layer 4 subdivisions receiving input from different functional streams.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is growing interest in the relation between the brain and music. The appealing similarity between brainwaves and the rhythms of music has motivated many scientists to seek a connection between them. A variety of transferring rules has been utilized to convert the brainwaves into music; and most of them are mainly based on spectra feature of EEG. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, audibly recognizable scale-free music was deduced from individual Electroencephalogram (EEG) waveforms. The translation rules include the direct mapping from the period of an EEG waveform to the duration of a note, the logarithmic mapping of the change of average power of EEG to music intensity according to the Fechner's law, and a scale-free based mapping from the amplitude of EEG to music pitch according to the power law. To show the actual effect, we applied the deduced sonification rules to EEG segments recorded during rapid-eye movement sleep (REM) and slow-wave sleep (SWS). The resulting music is vivid and different between the two mental states; the melody during REM sleep sounds fast and lively, whereas that in SWS sleep is slow and tranquil. 60 volunteers evaluated 25 music pieces, 10 from REM, 10 from SWS and 5 from white noise (WN), 74.3% experienced a happy emotion from REM and felt boring and drowsy when listening to SWS, and the average accuracy for all the music pieces identification is 86.8%(kappa = 0.800, P<0.001). We also applied the method to the EEG data from eyes closed, eyes open and epileptic EEG, and the results showed these mental states can be identified by listeners. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The sonification rules may identify the mental states of the brain, which provide a real-time strategy for monitoring brain activities and are potentially useful to neurofeedback therapy.},

@article{frey2007a,
	Abstract = {When processing complex visual input, human observers sequentially allocate their attention to different subsets of the stimulus. What are the mechanisms and strategies that guide this selection process? We investigated the influence of various stimulus features on human overt attention--that is, attention related to shifts of gaze with natural color images and modified versions thereof. Our experimental modifications, systematic changes of hue across the entire image, influenced only the global appearance of the stimuli, leaving the local features under investigation unaffected. We demonstrated that these modifications consistently reduce the subjective interpretation of a stimulus as "natural" across observers. By analyzing fixations, we found that first-order features, such as luminance contrast, saturation, and color contrast along either of the cardinal axes, correlated to overt attention in the modified images. In contrast, no such correlation was found in unmodified outdoor images. Second-order luminance contrast ("texture contrast") correlated to overt attention in all conditions. However, although none of the second-order color contrasts were correlated to overt attention in unmodified images, one of the second-order color contrasts did exhibit a significant correlation in the modified images. These findings imply, on the one hand, that higher-order bottom-up effects--namely, those of second-order luminance contrast--may partially account for human overt attention. On the other hand, these results also demonstrate that global image properties, which correlate to the subjective impression of a scene being "natural," affect the guidance of human overt attention.},

	Abstract = {1. We have examined the responses of simple cells in the cat's atriate cortex to visual patterns that were designed to reveal the extent to which these cells may be considered to sum light-evoked influences linearly across their receptive fields. We used one-dimensional luminance-modulated bars and grating as stimuli; their orientation was always the same as the preferred orientation of the neurone under study. The stimuli were presented on an oscilloscope screen by a digital computer, which also accumulated neuronal responses and controlled a randomized sequence of stimulus presentations. 2. The majority of simple cells respond to sinusoidal gratings that are moving or whose contrast is modulated in time in a manner consistent with the hypothesis that they have linear spatial summation. Their responses to moving gratings of all spatial frequencies are modulated in synchrony with the passage of the gratings' bars across their receptive fields, and they do not produce unmodulated responses even at the highest spatial frequencies. Many of these cells respond to temporally modulated stationary gratings simply by changing their response amplitude sinusoidally as the spatial phase of the grating the grating is varied. Nonetheless, their behavior appears to indicate linear spatial summation, since we show in an Appendix that the absence of a 'null' phase in a visual neurone need not indicate non-linear spatial summation, and further that a linear neurone lacking a 'null' phase should give responses of the form that we have observed in this type of simple cell. 3. A minority of simple cells appears to have significant non-linearities of spatial summation. These neurones respond to moving gratings of high spatial frequency with a partially or totally unmodulated elevation of firing rate. They have no 'null' phases when tested with stationary gratings, and reveal their non-linearity by giving responses to gratings of some spatial phases that are composed partly or wholly of even harmonics of the stimulus frequency ('on-off' responses). 4. We compared simple receptive fields with their sensitivity to sinusoidal gratings of different spatial frequencies. Qualitatively, the most sensitive subregions of simple cells' receptive fields are roughly the same width as the individual bars of the gratings to which they are most sensitive. Quantitatively, their receptive field profiles measured with thin stationary lines, agree well with predicted profiles derived by Fourier synthesis of their spatial frequency tuning curves.},

	Abstract = {Optical imaging of neuronal network activity yields information of spatial dynamics which generally is analyzed visually. The transient appearance of spatial activity patterns is difficult to gauge in a quantifiable manner, or may even altogether escape detection. Here, we employ geometric shape matching using Frechet distances or straight skeletons to search for pre-selected patterns in optical imaging data with adjustable degrees of tolerance. Data were sampled from fluorescence changes of a voltage-sensitive dye recorded with a 464-photodiode array. Fluorescence was monitored in a neuronal network in vitro. Neuronal activity prompting fluorescence fluctuations consisted of spontaneous epileptiform discharges in neocortical slices from patients undergoing epilepsy surgery. The experiments show that: (a) spatial activity patterns can be detected in optical imaging data; (b) shapes such as `mini-foci' appear in close correlation to bioelectric discharges monitored with field potential electrodes in a reproducible manner; (c) Frechet distances yield more conservative matches regarding rectangular, and less conservative hits with respect to radially symmetric shapes than the straight skeleton approach; and (d) tolerances of 0.03-0.1 are suited to detect faithful images of pre-selected shapes, whereas values >0.8 will report matches with any polygonal pattern. In conclusion, the methods reported here are suited to detect and analyze spatial, geometric dynamics in optical imaging data.},

	Abstract = {Our visual system constantly selects salient features in the environment, so that only those features are attended and targeted by further processing efforts to identify them. Models of feature detection hypothesize that salient features are localized based on contrast energy (local variance in intensity) in the visual stimulus. This hypothesis, however, has not been tested directly. We used psychophysical reverse correlation to study how humans detect and identify basic image features (bars and short line segments). Subjects detected a briefly flashed 'target bar' that was embedded in 'noise bars' that randomly changed in intensity over space and time. By studying how the intensity of the noise bars affected performance, we were able to dissociate two processing stages: an early 'detection' stage, whereby only locations of high-contrast energy in the image are selected, followed (after approximately 100 ms) by an 'identification' stage, whereby image intensity at selected locations is used to determine the identity (whether bright or dark) of the target.},

	Abstract = {The reduction of the brightness when a light beam's entry into the eye is shifted from the centre to the edge of the pupil has from the outset been shown to be due to a change in luminous efficiency of radiation when it is incident obliquely on the retina. The phenomenon is most prominent in photopic vision and this has concentrated attention on the properties of retinal cones, where responsibility has yet to be assigned to factors such as differences in shape, fine structure and configuration, and membrane anchoring of photopigment molecules. Geometrical optics and waveguide formulations have been applied to the question of how light is guided in receptors, but details of their geometry and optical parameters even if they become available will make calculations complex and of only moderate generality. In practice, the diminution of oblique light helps visual performance by reducing deleterious influence of ocular aberrations and of glare caused by light scattering when the pupil is wide. Receptor orientation can come into play in ocular conditions due to mechanical disturbance and has been shown to have potentiality as a tool for clinical diagnosis. Currently, open questions include microanatomical and molecular differences between rods and cones, the coupling of the optical image of the eye with the transducing apparatus in the photoreceptors, possible phototropism and more convincing methods of estimating the actual spatial distribution of photon events as it affects visual resolution.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Over the years, subtotal thyroidectomy has been the mainstay of treatment for toxic goitre; however, total thyroidectomy is increasingly being considered as the procedure of choice. This study aimed to review our experience with total thyroidectomy in toxic goitre and evaluate the outcome of this procedure. METHODS: A total of 67 consecutive patients who were diagnosed with toxic goitres and had total thyroidectomy from January 2003 to February 2005 were included in this prospective open study. The preoperative diagnosis in all patients was benign goitre. The surgical outcomes were reviewed with regard to mortality and morbidity. RESULTS: A standardized operative technique was adopted and practiced among all surgeons in our department. Of the 67 patients with toxic goitre, 36 (53.7%) patients had toxic multinodular goitre (Plummer's disease) and 31 (46.3%) patients had diffuse goitre (Graves' disease). Although there were no documented injuries to the recurrent laryngeal nerves, one patient had temporary hoarseness of voice. In our series of total thyroidectomy, 18 patients (26.8%) developed transient hypocalcaemia but only one patient (1.5%) had persistent hypocalcaemia. Four (5.9%) patients had occult papillary thyroid cancer and one patient (1.5%) had Hashimoto's thyroiditis discovered on histological examination. There were no other postoperative complications except for wound infection in one patient (1.5%). CONCLUSION: Total thyroidectomy should be considered as the procedure of choice for toxic goitres. It is paramount that sufficient attention be paid to the preservation of the laryngeal nerves and the parathyroid glands.},

@article{wallace1996a,
	Abstract = {1. The properties of visual-, auditory-, and somatosensory-responsive neurons, as well as of neurons responsive to multiple sensory cues (i.e., multisensory), were examined in the superior colliculus of the rhesus monkey. Although superficial layer neurons responded exclusively to visual stimuli and visual inputs predominated in deeper layers, there was also a rich nonvisual and multisensory representation in the superior colliculus. More than a quarter (27.8%) of the deep layer population responded to stimuli from more than a single sensory modality. In contrast, 37% responded only to visual cues, 17.6% to auditory cues, and 17.6% to somatosensory cues. Unimodal- and multisensory-responsive neurons were clustered by modality. Each of these modalities was represented in map-like fashion, and the different representations were in alignment with one another. 2. Most deep layer visually responsive neurons were binocular and exhibited poor selectivity for such stimulus characteristics as orientation, velocity, and direction of movement. Similarly, most auditory-responsive neurons had contralateral receptive fields and were binaural, but had little frequency selectivity and preferred complex, broad-band sounds. Somatosensory-responsive neurons were overwhelmingly contralateral, high velocity, and rapidly adapting. Only rarely did somatosensory-responsive neurons require distortion of subcutaneous tissue for activation. 3. The spatial congruence among the different receptive fields of multisensory neurons was a critical feature underlying their ability to synthesize cross-modal information. 4. Combinations of stimuli could have very different consequences in the same neuron, depending on their temporal and spatial relationships. Generally, multisensory interactions were evident when pairs of stimuli were separated from one another by < 500 ms, and the products of these interactions far exceeded the sum of their unimodal components. Whether the combination of stimuli produced response enhancement, response depression, or no interaction depended on the location of the stimuli relative to one another and to their respective receptive fields. Maximal response enhancements were observed when stimuli originated from similar locations in space (as when derived from the same event) because they fell within the excitatory receptive fields of the same multisensory neurons. If, however, the stimuli were spatially disparate such that one fell beyond the excitatory borders of its receptive field, either no interaction was produced or this stimulus depressed the effectiveness of the other. Furthermore, maximal response interactions were seen with the pairing of weakly effective unimodal stimuli. As the individual unimodal stimuli became increasingly effective, the levels of response enhancement to stimulus combinations declined, a principle referred to as inverse effectiveness. Many of the integrative principles seen here in the primate superior colliculus are strikingly similar to those observed in the cat. These observations indicate that a set of common principles of multisensory integration is adaptable in widely divergent species living in very different ecological situations. 5. Surprisingly, a few multisensory neurons had individual receptive fields that were not in register with one another. This has not been noted in multisensory neurons of other species, and these "anomalous" receptive fields could present a daunting problem: stimuli originating from the same general location in space cannot simultaneously fall within their respective receptive fields, a stimulus pairing that may result in response depression. Conversely, stimuli that originate from separate events and disparate locations (and fall within their receptive fields) may result in response enhancement. However, the spatial principle of multisensory integration did not apply in these cases. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)},

@article{webster2002a,
	Abstract = {We used a hue-scaling task to examine changes in color perception resulting from adaptation or induction to color contrast in spatially-varying backgrounds. Observers judged the perceived color of tests after or while viewing backgrounds composed of color differences along selected axes in color space. Both contrast adaptation and contrast induction produced large and selective shifts in perceived hue angle, and interacted in similar ways when combined, suggesting that they had functionally similar influences on perceived hue. Both also consistently biased perceived hue away from the color axis of the background, implying response changes within multiple channels tuned to different directions in color space. Selective hue changes were also observed when the gamut of colors forming the backgrounds were drawn from natural color distributions. This suggests that color perception in different environments may be systematically biased by adaptation to the distributions of colors in those environments. However, we did not find these biases when the same test stimuli were judged after adapting to actual natural scenes.},

	Abstract = {The primary visual cortex (V1) is the first cortical area to receive visual input, and inferior temporal (IT) areas are among the last along the ventral visual pathway. We recorded, in area V1 of anaesthetized cats and area IT of awake macaque monkeys, responses of neurons to videos of natural scenes. Responses were analysed to test various hypotheses concerning the nature of neural coding in these two regions. A variety of spike-train statistics were measured including spike-count distributions, interspike interval distributions, coefficients of variation, power spectra, Fano factors and different sparseness measures. All statistics showed non-Poisson characteristics and several revealed self-similarity of the spike trains. Spike-count distributions were approximately exponential in both visual areas for eight different videos and for counting windows ranging from 50 ms to 5 seconds. The results suggest that the neurons maximize their information carrying capacity while maintaining a fixed long-term-average firing rate, or equivalently, minimize their average firing rate for a fixed information carrying capacity.},

	Abstract = {Natural images contain characteristic statistical regularities that set them apart from purely random images. Understanding what these regularities are can enable natural images to be coded more efficiently. In this paper, we describe some of the forms of structure that are contained in natural images, and we show how these are related to the response properties of neurons at early stages of the visual system. Many of the important forms of structure require higher-order (i.e. more than linear, pairwise) statistics to characterize, which makes models based on linear Hebbian learning, or principal components analysis, inappropriate for finding efficient codes for natural images. We suggest that a good objective for an efficient coding of natural scenes is to maximize the sparseness of the representation, and we show that a network that learns sparse codes of natural scenes succeeds in developing localized, oriented, bandpass receptive fields similar to those in the mammalian striate cortex.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes an investigation of eye movements made by eighteen observers with normal spatial vision in response to eleven images of natural scenes each of which was presented in three versions, unfiltered filtered by low-pass and filtered by high-pass spatial frequency filters. The ability of observers to identify the different images was determined after each set of measurements. An index of similarity, calculated in terms of the sum of the squares of the distances between each fixation point and its nearest neighbour in the other set, was developed in order to provide a basis for the comparison of two sets of eye movements, each made by a different observer or both made on different occasions by the same observer. Application of this index shows that brief (1.5-s) presentation, there exists a high degree of similarity between fixations made by different observers in response to the same image. For longer (3-s) periods, however, the similarity for inter-observer comparisons is reduced. The data demonstrate that filtering of the image has little effect on the pattern of fixations made to a given image, but the duration of fixations is greatest for low-pass filtered images and least for unfiltered images, whereas the amplitude of saccades is greatest for unfiltered images and least for low-pass filtered images. It is proposed that for brief presentations, eye movements made during examination of an unfamiliar image are performed automatically in response to the spatial features of the image.},

According to the above-mentioned hypothesis, to stop smoking would decrease the risk of GH but increase the risk of HH. Also, smoking has been identified as one of the risk factors for the development or worsening of eye changes after 131I treatment of GH. Additionally, the outcome of medical treatment of Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO) is less favourable in smokers as compared to non-smokers. There is concern also about the effect of passive smoking on autoimmune thyroid disease. In a recent study it has been shown that the latter may have a deleterious effect on childhood GO.},

@article{mizokami2004a,
	Abstract = {We used color contrast adaptation to examine the chromatic and contrast selectivity of central color mechanisms. Adaptation to a field whose color varies along a single axis of color space induces a selective loss in sensitivity to the adapting axis. The resulting changes in color appearance are consistent with mechanisms formed by different linear combinations of the cone signals. We asked whether the visual system could also adjust to higher-order variations in the adapting stimulus, by adapting observers to interleaved variations along both the L versus M and the S versus LM cardinal axes. The perceived hue of test stimuli was then measured with an asymmetric matching task. Frequency analysis of the hue shifts revealed weak but systematic hue rotations away from each cardinal axis and toward the diagonal intermediate axes. Such shifts could arise if the adapted channels include mechanisms with narrow chromatic selectivity, as some physiological recordings suggest, but could also reflect how adaptation alters the contrast response function. In either case they imply the presence of more than two mechanisms within the chromatic plane. In a second set of measurements, we adapted to either the L versus M or the S versus LM axis alone and tested whether the changes in hue could be accounted for by changes in relative contrast along the two axes. For high contrasts the hue biases are larger than the contrast changes predict. This dissociation implies that the contrast and hue changes are not carried by a common underlying signal, and could arise if the contrast along a single color direction is encoded by more than one mechanism with different contrast sensitivities or if different subsets of channels encode contrast and hue. Such variations in contrast sensitivity are also consistent with physiological recordings of cortical neurons.},

	Abstract = {How does a visual search goal modulate the activity of neurons encoding different visual features (e.g., color, direction of motion)? Previous research suggests that goal-driven attention enhances the gain of neurons representing the target's visual features. Here, we present mathematical and behavioral evidence that this strategy is suboptimal and that humans do not deploy it. We formally derive the optimal feature gain modulation theory, which combines information from both the target and distracting clutter to maximize the relative salience of the target. We qualitatively validate the theory against existing electrophysiological and psychophysical literature. A surprising prediction is that it is sometimes optimal to enhance nontarget features. We provide experimental evidence toward this through psychophysics experiments on human subjects, thus suggesting that humans deploy the optimal gain modulation strategy.},

@article{foster2006a,
	Abstract = {To what extent do observers' judgments of surface color with natural scenes depend on global image statistics? To address this question, a psychophysical experiment was performed in which images of natural scenes under two successive daylights were presented on a computer-controlled high-resolution color monitor. Observers reported whether there was a change in reflectance of a test surface in the scene. The scenes were obtained with a hyperspectral imaging system and included variously trees, shrubs, grasses, ferns, flowers, rocks, and buildings. Discrimination performance, quantified on a scale of 0 to 1 with a color-constancy index, varied from 0.69 to 0.97 over 21 scenes and two illuminant changes, from a correlated color temperature of 25,000 K to 6700 K and from 4000 K to 6700 K. The best account of these effects was provided by receptor-based rather than colorimetric properties of the images. Thus, in a linear regression, 43% of the variance in constancy index was explained by the log of the mean relative deviation in spatial cone-excitation ratios evaluated globally across the two images of a scene. A further 20% was explained by including the mean chroma of the first image and its difference from that of the second image and a further 7% by the mean difference in hue. Together, all four global color properties accounted for 70% of the variance and provided a good fit to the effects of scene and of illuminant change on color constancy, and, additionally, of changing test-surface position. By contrast, a spatial-frequency analysis of the images showed that the gradient of the luminance amplitude spectrum accounted for only 5% of the variance.},

	Abstract = {Central to the concept of attention is the fact that identical stimuli can be processed in different ways. In olfaction, attention may designate the identical flow of air through the nose as either respiration or olfactory exploration. Here we have used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to probe this attentional mechanism in primary olfactory cortex (POC). We report a dissociation in POC that revealed attention-dependent and attention-independent subregions. Whereas a temporal subregion comprising temporal piriform cortex (PirT) responded equally across conditions, a frontal subregion comprising frontal piriform cortex (PirF) and the olfactory tubercle responded preferentially to attended sniffs as opposed to unattended sniffs. In addition, a task-specific anticipatory response occurred in the attention-dependent region only. This dissociation was consistent across two experimental designs: one focusing on sniffs of clean air, the other focusing on odor-laden sniffs. Our findings highlight the role of attention at the earliest cortical levels of olfactory processing.},

@article{muller2003a,
	Abstract = {By voluntarily directing attention to a specific region of a visual scene, we can improve our perception of stimuli at that location. This ability to focus attention upon specific zones of the visual field has been described metaphorically as a moveable spotlight or zoom lens that facilitates the processing of stimuli within its 'beam'. A long-standing controversy has centred on the question of whether the spotlight of spatial attention has a unitary beam or whether it can be divided flexibly to disparate locations. Evidence supporting the unitary spotlight view has come from numerous behavioural and electrophysiological studies. Recent experiments, however, indicate that the spotlight of spatial attention may be divided between non-contiguous zones of the visual field for very brief stimulus exposures ({\&}<100 ms). Here we use an electrophysiological measure of attentional allocation (the steady-state visual evoked potential) to show that the spotlight may be divided between spatially separated locations (excluding interposed locations) over more extended time periods. This spotlight division appears to be accomplished at an early stage of visual-cortical processing.},

	Abstract = {We investigated how the brain selects the targets for eye movements, a process in which the outcome of visual processing is converted into guided action. Macaque monkeys were trained to make a saccade to fixate a salient target presented either alone or with multiple distractors during visual search. Neural activity was recorded in the frontal eye field, a cortical area at the interface of visual processing and eye movement production. Neurons discharging after stimulus presentation and before saccade initiation were analyzed. The initial visual response of frontal eye field neurons was modulated by the presence of multiple stimuli and by whether a saccade was going to be produced, but the initial visual response did not discriminate the target of the search array from the distractors. In the latent period before saccade initiation, the activity of most visually responsive cells evolved to signal the location of the target. Target selection occurred through suppression of distractor evoked activity contingent on the location of the target relative to the receptive field. The evolution of a signal specifying the location of the salient target could be dissociated from saccade initiation in some cells and could occur even when fixation was maintained. Neural activity in the frontal eye fields may participate in or be the product of the decision process guiding eye movements.},

@article{celebrini1994a,
	Abstract = {We recorded the responses of single neurons in extrastriate area MST while rhesus monkeys discriminated the direction of motion in a set of stochastic visual displays. By varying systematically the strength of a coherent motion signal within the visual display, we were able to measure simultaneously the monkeys' psychophysical thresholds for direction discrimination and the responses of single neurons to the same motion signals. Neuronal thresholds for reliably signaling the direction of motion in the visual display were calculated from the measured responses using a method based in signal detection theory. Neurons in MST were exquisitely sensitive to motion signals in the display, having thresholds for discriminating the direction of coherent motion that were, on average, equal to the psychophysical thresholds of the monkeys. For many MST neurons, the intensity of the response was correlated with the monkey's psychophysical judgements for repeated presentations of a given near-threshold stimulus; the monkey tended to choose the preferred direction of the neuron under study when that neuron responded more strongly to the stimulus. In both of these respects, MST neurons were indistinguishable from neurons in extrastriate area MT, a major source of afferent input to MST. In a second set of experiments, we found that both of these results held true in the face of pronounced manipulations of the visual stimulus. Severe reductions in stimulus size and speed, for example, compromised neuronal and psychophysical sensitivities by similar amounts so that the average neuronal and psychophysical thresholds remained approximately equal. In addition, the trial-to-trial covariation of neuronal response and perceptual decision was unaffected by our stimulus manipulations. Thus, MST neurons carry signals appropriate for supporting psychophysical performance on our task over an impressively wide range of stimulus configurations.},

	Abstract = {The nervous system of the leech is a particularly suitable model to investigate neural coding of sensorimotor responses because it allows both observation of behavior and the simultaneous measurement of a large fraction of its underlying neuronal activity. In this study, we used a combination of multielectrode recordings, videomicroscopy, and computation of the optical flow to investigate the reproducibility of the motor response caused by local mechanical stimulation of the leech skin. We analyzed variability at different levels of processing: mechanosensory neurons, motoneurons, muscle activation, and behavior. Spike trains in mechanosensory neurons were very reproducible, unlike those in motoneurons. The motor response, however, was reproducible because of two distinct biophysical mechanisms. First, leech muscles contract slowly and therefore are poorly sensitive to the jitter of motoneuron spikes. Second, the motor response results from the coactivation of a population of motoneurons firing in a statistically independent way, which reduces the variability of the population firing. These data show that reproducible spike trains are not required to sustain reproducible behaviors and illustrate how the nervous system can cope with unreliable components to produce reliable action.},

	Abstract = {An analysis of response latencies shows that when an image is presented to the visual system, neuronal activity is rapidly routed to a large number of visual areas. However, the activity of cortical neurons is not determined by this feedforward sweep alone. Horizontal connections within areas, and higher areas providing feedback, result in dynamic changes in tuning. The differences between feedforward and recurrent processing could prove pivotal in understanding the distinctions between attentive and pre-attentive vision as well as between conscious and unconscious vision. The feedforward sweep rapidly groups feature constellations that are hardwired in the visual brain, yet is probably incapable of yielding visual awareness; in many cases, recurrent processing is necessary before the features of an object are attentively grouped and the stimulus can enter consciousness.},

	Abstract = {Modern brain imaging techniques have now made it possible to study the neural sites and mechanisms underlying crossmodal processing in the human brain. This paper reviews positron emission tomography, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), event-related potential and magnetoencephalographic studies of crossmodal matching, the crossmodal integration of content and spatial information, and crossmodal learning. These investigations are beginning to produce some consistent findings regarding the neuronal networks involved in these distinct crossmodal operations. Increasingly, specific roles are being defined for the superior temporal sulcus, the inferior parietal sulcus, regions of frontal cortex, the insula cortex and claustrum. The precise network of brain areas implicated in any one study, however, seems to be heavily dependent on the experimental paradigms used, the nature of the information being combined and the particular combination of modalities under investigation. The different analytic strategies adopted by different groups may also be a significant factor contributing to the variability in findings. In this paper, we demonstrate the impact of computing intersections, conjunctions and interaction effects on the identification of audiovisual integration sites using existing fMRI data from our own laboratory. This exercise highlights the potential value of using statistical interaction effects to model electrophysiological responses to crossmodal stimuli in order to identify possible sites of multisensory integration in the human brain.},

	Abstract = {We show that when a moving object suddenly reverses direction, there is a brief, synchronous burst of firing within a population of retinal ganglion cells. This burst can be driven by either the leading or trailing edge of the object. The latency is constant for movement at different speeds, objects of different size, and bright versus dark contrasts. The same ganglion cells that signal a motion reversal also respond to smooth motion. We show that the brain can build a pure reversal detector using only a linear filter that reads out synchrony from a group of ganglion cells. These results indicate that not only can the retina anticipate the location of a smoothly moving object, but that it can also signal violations in its own prediction. We show that the reversal response cannot be explained by models of the classical receptive field and suggest that nonlinear receptive field subunits may be responsible.},

	Abstract = {Breeding goals in pigs are subject to change and are directed much more toward retail carcass yield and meat quality because of the high economic value of these traits. The objective of this study was to estimate genetic parameters of growth, carcass, and meat quality traits. Carcass components included ham and loin weights as primal cuts, which were further dissected into boneless subprimal cuts. Meat quality traits included pH, drip loss, purge, firmness, and color and marbling of both ham and loin. Phenotypic measurements were collected on a commercial crossbred pig population (n = 1,855). Genetic parameters were estimated using REML procedures applied to a bivariate animal model. Heritability estimates for carcass traits varied from 0.29 to 0.51, with 0.39 and 0.51 for the boneless subprimals of ham and loin, respectively. Heritability estimates for meat quality traits ranged from 0.08 to 0.28, with low estimates for the water holding capacity traits and higher values for the color traits: Minolta b*(0.14), L* (0.15), a* (0.24), and Japanese color scale (0.25). Heritability estimates differed for marbling of ham (0.14) and loin (0.31). Neither backfat nor ADG was correlated with loin depth (r(g) = 0.0), and their mutual genetic correlation was 0.27. Loin primal was moderately correlated with ham primal (r(g) = 0.31) and more strongly correlated with boneless ham (r(g) = 0.58). Backfat was negatively correlated with (sub)primal cut values. Average daily gain was unfavorably correlated with subprimals and with most meat quality characteristics measured. Genetic correlations among the color measurements and water-holding capacity traits were high (average r(g) = 0.70), except for Minolta a* (average r(g) = 0.17). The estimated genetic parameters indicate that meat quality and valuable cut yields can be improved by genetic selection. The estimated genetic parameters make it possible to predict the response to selection on performance, carcass, and meat quality traits and to design an effective breeding strategy fitting pricing systems based on retail carcass and quality characteristics.},

	Abstract = {Single-unit recording studies in the macaque have carefully documented the modulatory effects of attention on the response properties of visual cortical neurons. Attention produces qualitatively different effects on firing rate, depending on whether a stimulus appears alone or accompanied by distracters. Studies of contrast gain control in anesthetized mammals have found parallel patterns of results when the luminance contrast of a stimulus increases. This finding suggests that attention has co-opted the circuits that mediate contrast gain control and that it operates by increasing the effective contrast of the attended stimulus. Consistent with this idea, microstimulation of the frontal eye fields, one of several areas that control the allocation of spatial attention, induces spatially local increases in sensitivity both at the behavioral level and among neurons in area V4, where endogenously generated attention increases contrast sensitivity. Studies in the slice have begun to explain how modulatory signals might cause such increases in sensitivity.},

	Abstract = {In the vertebrate brain external stimuli are often represented in distinct functional domains distributed across the cortical surface. Fast imaging techniques used to measure patterns of population activity record movies with many pixels and many frames, i.e., data sets with high dimensionality. Here we demonstrate that principal component analysis (PCA) followed by spatial independent component analysis (sICA), can be exploited to reduce the dimensionality of data sets recorded in the olfactory bulb and the somatosensory cortex of mice as well as the visual cortex of monkeys, without loosing the stimulus-specific responses. Different neuronal populations are separated based on their stimulus-specific spatiotemporal activation. Both, spatial and temporal response characteristics can be objectively obtained, simultaneously. In the olfactory bulb, groups of glomeruli with different response latencies can be identified. This is shown for recordings of olfactory receptor neuron input measured with a calcium-sensitive axon tracer and for network dynamics measured with the voltage-sensitive dye RH 1838. In the somatosensory cortex, barrels responding to the stimulation of single whiskers can be automatically detected. In the visual cortex orientation columns can be extracted. In all cases artifacts due to movement, heartbeat or respiration were separated from the functional signal by sICA and could be removed from the data set. sICA following PCA is therefore a powerful technique for data compression, unbiased analysis and dissection of imaging data of population activity, collected with high spatial and temporal resolution.},

	Abstract = {We discuss behavioral studies directed at understanding how probability information is represented in motor and economic tasks. By formulating the behavioral tasks in the language of statistical decision theory, we can compare performance in equivalent tasks in different domains. Subjects in traditional economic decision-making tasks often misrepresent the probability of rare events and typically fail to maximize expected gain. By contrast, subjects in mathematically equivalent movement tasks often choose movement strategies that come close to maximizing expected gain. We discuss the implications of these different outcomes, noting the evident differences between the source of uncertainty and how information about uncertainty is acquired in motor and economic tasks.},

	Abstract = {The horizontal separation of the eyes means that objects nearer or farther than the fixation point project to different locations on the two retinae, differing principally in their horizontal coordinates (horizontal binocular disparity). Disparity-selective neurons have generally been studied with disparities applied in only one direction (often horizontal), which cannot determine whether the encoding is specialized for processing disparities along the horizontal axis. It is therefore unclear if disparity selectivity represents a specialization for naturally occurring disparities. I used random dot stereograms to study disparity-selective neurons from the primary visual cortex (V1) of awake fixating monkeys. Many combinations of vertical and horizontal disparity were used, characterizing the surface of responses as a function of two-dimensional disparity. Here I report that the response surface usually showed elongation along the horizontal disparity axis, despite the isotropic stimulus. Thus these neurons modulated their firing rate over a wider range of horizontal disparity than vertical disparity. This demonstrates that disparity-selective cells are specialized for processing horizontal disparity, and that existing models of disparity selectivity require substantial revision.},

@article{reynolds1999a,
	Abstract = {It is well established that attention modulates visual processing in extrastriate cortex. However, the underlying neural mechanisms are unknown. A consistent observation is that attention has its greatest impact on neuronal responses when multiple stimuli appear together within a cell's receptive field. One way to explain this is to assume that multiple stimuli activate competing populations of neurons and that attention biases this competition in favor of the attended stimulus. In the absence of competing stimuli, there is no competition to be resolved. Accordingly, attention has a more limited effect on the neuronal response to a single stimulus. To test this interpretation, we measured the responses of neurons in macaque areas V2 and V4 using a behavioral paradigm that allowed us to isolate automatic sensory processing mechanisms from attentional effects. First, we measured each cell's response to a single stimulus presented alone inside the receptive field or paired with a second receptive field stimulus, while the monkey attended to a location outside the receptive field. Adding the second stimulus typically caused the neuron's response to move toward the response that was elicited by the second stimulus alone. Then, we directed the monkey's attention to one element of the pair. This drove the neuron's response toward the response elicited when the attended stimulus appeared alone. These findings are consistent with the idea that attention biases competitive interactions among neurons, causing them to respond primarily to the attended stimulus. A quantitative neural model of attention is proposed to account for these results.},

@article{zhaoping2008a,
	Abstract = {Visual object recognition and sensitivity to image features are largely influenced by contextual inputs. We study influences by contextual bars on the bias to perceive or infer the presence of a target bar, rather than on the sensitivity to image features. Human observers judged from a briefly presented stimulus whether a target bar of a known orientation and shape is present at the center of a display, given a weak or missing input contrast at the target location with or without a context of other bars. Observers are more likely to perceive a target when the context has a weaker rather than stronger contrast. When the context can perceptually group well with the would-be target, weak contrast contextual bars bias the observers to perceive a target relative to the condition without contexts, as if to fill in the target. Meanwhile, high-contrast contextual bars, regardless of whether they group well with the target, bias the observers to perceive no target. A Bayesian model of visual inference is shown to account for the data well, illustrating that the context influences the perception in two ways: (1) biasing observers' prior belief that a target should be present according to visual grouping principles, and (2) biasing observers' internal model of the likely input contrasts caused by a target bar. According to this model, our data suggest that the context does not influence the perceived target contrast despite its influence on the bias to perceive the target's presence, thereby suggesting that cortical areas beyond the primary visual cortex are responsible for the visual inferences.},

@article{ito2003a,
	Abstract = {According to a widely cited finding by Ellis and Stark (1978 Perception 7 575-581), the duration of eye fixations is longer at the instant of perceptual reversal of an ambiguous figure than before or after the reversal. However, long fixations are more likely to include samples of an independent random event than are short fixations. This sampling bias would produce the pattern of results also when no correlation exists between fixation duration and perceptual reversals. When an appropriate correction is applied to the measurement of fixation durations, the effect disappears. In fact, there are fewer actual button-presses during the long intervals than would be expected by chance. Moving-window analyses performed on eye-fixation data reveal that no unique eye event is associated with switching behaviour. However, several indicators, such as blink frequency, saccade frequency, and the direction of the saccade, are each differentially sensitive to perceptual and response-related aspects of the switching process. The time course of these indicators depicts switching behaviour as a process of cascaded stages.},

	Abstract = {A picture viewed from its center of projection generates the same retinal image as the original scene, so the viewer perceives the scene correctly. When a picture is viewed from other locations, the retinal image specifies a different scene, but we normally do not notice the changes. We investigated the mechanism underlying this perceptual invariance by studying the perceived shapes of pictured objects viewed from various locations. We also manipulated information about the orientation of the picture surface. When binocular information for surface orientation was available, perceived shape was nearly invariant across a wide range of viewing angles. By varying the projection angle and the position of a stimulus in the picture, we found that invariance is achieved through an estimate of local surface orientation, not from geometric information in the picture. We present a model that explains invariance and other phenomena (such as perceived distortions in wide-angle pictures).},

@article{murphy2009a,
	Abstract = {In cerebral cortex, ongoing activity absent a stimulus can resemble stimulus-driven activity in size and structure. In particular, spontaneous activity in cat primary visual cortex (V1) has structure significantly correlated with evoked responses to oriented stimuli. This suggests that, from unstructured input, cortical circuits selectively amplify specific activity patterns. Current understanding of selective amplification involves elongation of a neural assembly's lifetime by mutual excitation among its neurons. We introduce a new mechanism for selective amplification without elongation of lifetime: "balanced amplification." Strong balanced amplification arises when feedback inhibition stabilizes strong recurrent excitation, a pattern likely to be typical of cortex. Thus, balanced amplification should ubiquitously contribute to cortical activity. Balanced amplification depends on the fact that individual neurons project only excitatory or only inhibitory synapses. This leads to a hidden feedforward connectivity between activity patterns. We show in a detailed biophysical model that this can explain the cat V1 observations.},

	Abstract = {The representations of visual space and stimulus orientation were mapped in the cat primary visual cortex using electrophysiological recordings supplemented with intrinsic signal optical imaging. The majority of units displaced up to 600 micro m laterally had overlapping RFs both in orientation domains and around singularities of the orientation map. Quantitative comparison of these units revealed only a weak, positive correlation between the difference in their preferred orientations and RF separations (area 17: r = 0.09; area 18: r = 0.15). The occurrence of nonoverlapping RFs could be accounted for by random RF position scatter rather than by orientation difference between the units. Monte Carlo analysis showed that our findings are compatible with a locally smooth and linear representation of visual space that is not coupled to the representation of stimulus orientation. An important functional implication of the above map relationships is that positional information captured by the retina is faithfully transmitted into the cortex.},

	Abstract = {Although information storage in the central nervous system is thought to be primarily mediated by various forms of synaptic plasticity, other mechanisms, such as modifications in membrane excitability, are available. Local dendritic spikes are nonlinear voltage events that are initiated within dendritic branches by spatially clustered and temporally synchronous synaptic input. That local spikes selectively respond only to appropriately correlated input allows them to function as input feature detectors and potentially as powerful information storage mechanisms. However, it is currently unknown whether any effective form of local dendritic spike plasticity exists. Here we show that the coupling between local dendritic spikes and the soma of rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons can be modified in a branch-specific manner through an N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-dependent regulation of dendritic Kv4.2 potassium channels. These data suggest that compartmentalized changes in branch excitability could store multiple complex features of synaptic input, such as their spatio-temporal correlation. We propose that this 'branch strength potentiation' represents a previously unknown form of information storage that is distinct from that produced by changes in synaptic efficacy both at the mechanistic level and in the type of information stored.},

At the neuronal level, this could arise either through a multiplicative increase in firing rate or through an increase in the effective strength of the stimulus. To test conflicting predictions of these alternative models, we recorded responses of V4 neurons to stimuli across a range of luminance contrasts and measured the change in response when monkeys attended to them in order to discriminate a target stimulus from nontargets. Attention caused greater increases in response at low contrast than at high contrast, consistent with an increase in effective stimulus strength. On average, attention increased the effective contrast of the attended stimulus by a factor of 1.51, an increase of 51% of its physical contrast.},

	Abstract = {Although biological cells are mostly transparent, they are phase objects that differ in shape and refractive index. Any image that is projected through layers of randomly oriented cells will normally be distorted by refraction, reflection, and scattering. Counterintuitively, the retina of the vertebrate eye is inverted with respect to its optical function and light must pass through several tissue layers before reaching the light-detecting photoreceptor cells. Here we report on the specific optical properties of glial cells present in the retina, which might contribute to optimize this apparently unfavorable situation. We investigated intact retinal tissue and individual M{\"u}ller cells, which are radial glial cells spanning the entire retinal thickness. M{\"u}ller cells have an extended funnel shape, a higher refractive index than their surrounding tissue, and are oriented along the direction of light propagation. Transmission and reflection confocal microscopy of retinal tissue in vitro and in vivo showed that these cells provide a low-scattering passage for light from the retinal surface to the photoreceptor cells. Using a modified dual-beam laser trap we could also demonstrate that individual M{\"u}ller cells act as optical fibers. Furthermore, their parallel array in the retina is reminiscent of fiberoptic plates used for low-distortion image transfer. Thus, M{\"u}ller cells seem to mediate the image transfer through the vertebrate retina with minimal distortion and low loss. This finding elucidates a fundamental feature of the inverted retina as an optical system and ascribes a new function to glial cells.},

This article considers the effects of including chromatic and stereo information. The inclusion of colour leads to features divided into separate red/green, blue/yellow, and bright/dark channels. Stereo image data, on the other hand, leads to binocular receptive fields which are tuned to various disparities. The similarities between these results and the observed properties of simple cells in the primary visual cortex are further evidence for the hypothesis that visual cortical neurons perform some type of redundancy reduction, which was one of the original motivations for ICA in the first place. In addition, ICA provides a principled method for feature extraction from colour and stereo images; such features could be used in image processing operations such as denoising and compression, as well as in pattern recognition.},

	Abstract = {Recent change detection research demonstrates impressively that we do not retain and fuse the pictorial content of successive fixations. This raises two distinct issues: (1) when and how is point-by-point information lost or replaced? and (2) might more abstract information be extracted and retained from fixations? In this chapter I explore both of these issues. I consider the evidence for a very short-term richly detailed visual representation of the current target of fixation that survives the saccade but is overwritten by the content of each new fixation shortly after it begins. The possibility of abstract representations of the visual surroundings is then discussed. Under conditions of competitive, parallel processing, as are present in real life situations, multiple types of information are extracted and retained from complex natural scenes. Time courses for extraction vary between different types of information. The inclusion of eye movement data reveals a crucial role for fixations in information extraction. The data suggest that information assimilation into the representations tested here is dominated by the fovea and is integrated and accumulated from multiple foveations. From these studies we are able to construct a rudimentary framework, in which representational faithfulness and richness depend upon fixation history of that part of the visual scene, thus producing an efficient and potentially task-specific representation.},

	Abstract = {Haemodynamic signals underlying functional brain imaging (for example, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)) are assumed to reflect metabolic demand generated by local neuronal activity, with equal increases in haemodynamic signal implying equal increases in the underlying neuronal activity. Few studies have compared neuronal and haemodynamic signals in alert animals to test for this assumed correspondence. Here we present evidence that brings this assumption into question. Using a dual-wavelength optical imaging technique that independently measures cerebral blood volume and oxygenation, continuously, in alert behaving monkeys, we find two distinct components to the haemodynamic signal in the alert animals' primary visual cortex (V1). One component is reliably predictable from neuronal responses generated by visual input. The other component-of almost comparable strength-is a hitherto unknown signal that entrains to task structure independently of visual input or of standard neural predictors of haemodynamics. This latter component shows predictive timing, with increases of cerebral blood volume in anticipation of trial onsets even in darkness. This trial-locked haemodynamic signal could be due to an accompanying V1 arterial pumping mechanism, closely matched in time, with peaks of arterial dilation entrained to predicted trial onsets. These findings (tested in two animals) challenge the current understanding of the link between brain haemodynamics and local neuronal activity. They also suggest the existence of a novel preparatory mechanism in the brain that brings additional arterial blood to cortex in anticipation of expected tasks.},

	Abstract = {Due to fixational eye movements, the image on the retina is always in motion, even when one views a stationary scene. When an object moves within the scene, the corresponding patch of retina experiences a different motion trajectory than the surrounding region. Certain retinal ganglion cells respond selectively to this condition, when the motion in the cell's receptive field center is different from that in the surround. Here we show that this response is strongest at the very onset of differential motion, followed by gradual adaptation with a time course of several seconds. Different subregions of a ganglion cell's receptive field can adapt independently. The circuitry responsible for differential motion adaptation lies in the inner retina. Several candidate mechanisms were tested, and the adaptation most likely results from synaptic depression at the synapse from bipolar to ganglion cell. Similar circuit mechanisms may act more generally to emphasize novel features of a visual stimulus.},

	Abstract = {The temporal features of tactile stimuli are faithfully represented by the activity of neurons in the somatosensory cortex. However, the cellular mechanisms that enable cortical neurons to report accurate temporal information are not known. Here, we show that in the rodent barrel cortex, the temporal window for integration of thalamic inputs is under the control of thalamocortical feed-forward inhibition and can vary from 1 to 10 ms. A single thalamic fiber can trigger feed-forward inhibition and contacts both excitatory and inhibitory cortical neurons. The dynamics of feed-forward inhibition exceed those of each individual synapse in the circuit and are captured by a simple disynaptic model of the thalamocortical projection. The variations in the integration window produce changes in the temporal precision of cortical responses to whisker stimulation. Hence, feed-forward inhibitory circuits, classically known to sharpen spatial contrast of tactile inputs, also increase the temporal resolution in the somatosensory cortex.},

We recorded single unit activity and local field potentials in auditory cortex of two neurosurgical patients and compared them with the fMRI signals of 11 healthy subjects during presentation of an identical movie segment. The predicted fMRI signals derived from single units and the measured fMRI signals from auditory cortex showed a highly significant correlation (r = 0.75, P < 10(-47)). Thus, fMRI signals can provide a reliable measure of the firing rate of human cortical neurons.},

	Abstract = {The processing of visual information combines bottom-up sensory aspects with top-down influences, most notably attentional processes. Attentional influences have now been demonstrated throughout visual cortex, and their influence on the processing of visual information is profound. Neuronal responses to attended locations or stimulus features are enhanced, whereas those from unattended locations or features are suppressed. This influence of attention increases as one ascends the hierarchy of visual areas in primate cortex, ultimately resulting in a neural representation of the visual world that is dominated by the behavioral relevance of the information, rather than designed to provide an accurate and complete description of it. This realization has led to a rethinking of the role of areas that have previously been considered to be "purely sensory".},

Initially 14 older and 14 younger observers classified daytime and nighttime traffic scenes as containing low or high amounts of clutter. Next, an independent sample of 14 younger and 14 older participants searched for traffic signs contained within these scenes. Errors were more common among the elderly. Search efficiency declined with increased clutter and with aging. However, relative to the young, older adults did not suffer disproportionately as a result of increased clutter. The methods developed might be profitably employed to assess sign conspicuity and sign acquisition during driving.},

@article{letelier2006a,
	Abstract = {This article analyses the work of Robert Rosen on an interpretation of metabolic networks that he called (M,R) systems. His main contribution was an attempt to prove that metabolic closure (or metabolic circularity) could be explained in purely formal terms, but his work remains very obscure and we try to clarify his line of thought. In particular, we clarify the algebraic formulation of (M,R) systems in terms of mappings and sets of mappings, which is grounded in the metaphor of metabolism as a mathematical mapping. We define Rosen's central result as the mathematical expression in which metabolism appears as a mapping f that is the solution to a fixed-point functional equation. Crucially, our analysis reveals the nature of the mapping, and shows that to have a solution the set of admissible functions representing a metabolism must be drastically smaller than Rosen's own analysis suggested that it needed to be. For the first time, we provide a mathematical example of an (M,R) system with organizational invariance, and we analyse a minimal (three-step) autocatalytic set in the context of (M,R) systems. In addition, by extending Rosen's construction, we show how one might generate self-referential objects f with the remarkable property f(f)=f, where f acts in turn as function, argument and result. We conclude that Rosen's insight, although not yet in an easily workable form, represents a valuable tool for understanding metabolic networks.},

One of the changes was of high interest to the meaning of the scene, and the other was of lower interest. High-interest changes were more readily detected. To further examine the effects of contextual significance, we inverted the scene orientation to disrupt top-down effects of global context while controlling for contributions of visual salience. In other studies, inverting scene orientation has had inconsistent effects on detection of high-interest changes. However, this experiment demonstrated that inverting scene orientation significantly reduced the advantage for high-interest changes in comparison to lower-interest changes. Thus, scene context influences the deployment of attention and change-detection performance, and this top-down influence may be disrupted by scene inversion.},

	Abstract = {Hyperthyroidism is treated either by antithyroid drugs, radioiodine (I131) or surgery. In Sweden, surgery is often performed in patients with large goiter or severe hyperthyroidism with infiltrative endocrine ophthalmopathy. To evaluate indications and results of surgical treatment, data from 380 patients operated on for hyperthyroidism at our department during 1986-1995 were analyzed. Twenty-six percent were referred for surgery because of failure of treatment with antithyroid drugs or I131. Ninety-one percent were subjected to subtotal thyroidectomy with a median remnant weight of less than 2 g. In the remaining patients, total thyroidectomy was performed. Transient vocal cord affection occurred in 2.6%, none of which was permanent. Prolonged postoperative hypocalcemia occurred in 3.1%, and permanent hypoparathyroidism in 1%. There was no difference in complication rate between subtotal or total thyroidectomy. In patients with Graves' disease, 5% worsened with regard to ophthalmopathy initially after surgery but later improved. Recurrent disease occurred in 2% of the patients, all of whom had undergone subtotal thyroidectomy. Surgery is not first-line therapy in all patients with hyperthyroidism. However, in experienced hands, surgery is a good therapeutic alternative that can be carried out with no mortality, few complications, and, provided that a minimal remnant is left, very few recurrences.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent experience with thyroidectomy for Graves' disease is limited. We report our current experience with thyroidectomy for Graves' disease at a tertiary hospital. METHODS: A prospective database showed 48 patients who underwent surgery for Graves' disease from April 1993 to June 2005. RESULTS: All patients had typical symptoms of Graves' disease. Twenty-three patients had ophthalmopathy. Indications for surgery were failed medical therapy (n = 24), presence of a dominant nodule (n = 12), or refusal of radioiodine (n = 12). Surgery included total thyroidectomy (n = 46) or subtotal thyroidectomy (n = 2). The incidence of cancer was 17%. Long-term follow-up data were available for 44 patients. No patients had recurrence of hyperthyroidism or cancer. Follow-up evaluation of 20 patients with ophthalmopathy showed the condition had either stabilized or resolved. CONCLUSIONS: Total thyroidectomy for Graves' disease offers rapid and durable control of hyperthyroidism, provides appropriate treatment for patients with coexisting cancer, and can stabilize or reverse ophthalmopathy.},

	Abstract = {How does the brain synthesize low-level neural signals for simple shape parts into coherent representations of complete objects? Here, we present evidence for a dynamic process of object part integration in macaque posterior inferotemporal cortex (IT). Immediately after stimulus onset, neural responses carried information about individual object parts (simple contour fragments) only. Subsequently, information about specific multipart configurations emerged, building gradually over the course of approximately 60 ms, producing a sparser and more explicit representation of object shape. We show that this gradual transformation can be explained by a recurrent network process that effectively compares parts signals across neurons to generate inferences about multipart shape configurations.},

@article{creutzfeldt1978a,
	Abstract = {A method was developed to investigate transfer properties of neurons in the visual system using pictures of complex visual stimuli. The picture is moved over the receptive field of a neuron so that it can scan it along programmed lines. The activity of the neuron during the scanning procedure is presented in a two-dimensional dot display on scale with the original picture. By superposition of the stimulus and the transfer pattern, one can find out to which detail of a stimulus the neuron responds. Neurons in the first intracerebral relay of the visual system, the lateral geniculate body, reduce a complex stimulus, such as a photograph of a natural environment, to its contours. Cortical cells only respond to contours either of a limited or of a wider range of orientations (simple and complex cells, respectively). But the course of contours is only described by a continuous representation of these contours in the cortical map of the visual field. This is done by the simple cells, which have small receptive fields and thus a higher resolving power, whereas complex cells with their large receptive fields monitor the approximate location of a moving stimulus. The function of these two classes of neurons is discussed in terms of visual behavior, i.e., for fixation, hold, and binocular vergence movements (simple cells), and for detection of moving objects and motor command signals towards these objects (complex cells). These functions are an important condition for foveal vision which is the basis of perception in primates. An important function of orientation sensitivity of simple cells may be the binocular alignment of contours in binocular fusion and stereoscopic vision.},

@article{parkhurst2004a,
	Abstract = {In natural vision, the central nervous system actively selects information for detailed processing through mechanisms of visual attention. It is widely held that simple stimulus features such as color, orientation and intensity contribute to the determination of visual salience and thus can act to guide the selection process in a bottom-up fashion. Contrary to this view, Einh{\"a}user, W. {\&} Koenig, P. [(2003) Eur. J. Neurosci., 17, 1089-1097] conclude from their study of human eye movements that luminance contrast does not contribute to the calculation of stimulus salience and that top-down, rather than bottom-up, factors therefore determine attentional allocation in natural scenes. In this article, we dispute their conclusion and argue that the Einh{\"a}user and Koenig study has a number of methodological problems, the most prominent of which is the unintentional introduction of changes in texture contrast. We hypothesize that texture contrast, like luminance contrast, can contribute to the guidance of attention in a bottom-up fashion, and that an appeal to top-down factors is not necessary. To test this hypothesis, we implement a purely bottom-up model of visual selective attention where salience is derived from both luminance and texture contrast. We find that the model can quantitatively account for Einh{\"a}user and Koenig's results and that texture contrast strongly influences attentional guidance in this particular paradigm. The significance of this result for attentional guidance in other paradigms is discussed.},

There is, however, no consensus about the developmental origins or functional basis of this phenomenon. Here, we report the analysis of a large library of digitized scenes using image processing with orientation-sensitive filters. Our results show a prevalence of vertical and horizontal orientations in indoor, outdoor, and even entirely natural settings. Because visual experience is known to influence the development of visual cortical circuitry, we suggest that this real world anisotropy is related to the enhanced ability of humans and other animals to process contours in the cardinal axes, perhaps by stimulating the development of a greater amount of visual circuitry devoted to processing vertical and horizontal contours.},

	Abstract = {Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we tested whether unconscious information can influence the cognitive control system in the human prefrontal cortex. Volunteers had to prepare to perform either a phonological judgment or a semantic judgment on an upcoming word, based on the instruction given at the beginning of each trial. However, in some trials they were visually primed to prepare for the alternative (i.e., "wrong") task, and this impaired their performance. This priming effect is taken to depend on unconscious processes because the effect was present even when the volunteers could only discriminate the identity of the primes at chance level. Furthermore, the effect was stronger when the visibility of the prime was near zero than when the visibility of the prime was significantly higher. When volunteers were unconsciously primed to perform the alternative task, there was also decreased neural activity in the brain areas relevant to the instructed task and increased neural activity in the brain areas relevant to the alternative task, which shows that the volunteers were actually engaged in the wrong task, instead of simply being distracted. Activity in the mid-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was also found to be associated with this unconscious priming effect. These results suggest that the cognitive control system in the prefrontal cortex is not exclusively driven by conscious information, as has been believed previously.},

It is not clear, however, what information about a target is used to bias the underlying neuronal responses. We here engage subjects in a variety of simple conjunction search tasks while tracking their eye movements. We derive a generative model that reproduces these eye movements and calculate the conditional probabilities that observers fixate, given the target, on or near an item in the display sharing a specific feature with the target. We use these probabilities to infer which features were biased by top-down attention: Color seems to be the dominant stimulus dimension for guiding search, followed by object size, and lastly orientation. We use the number of fixations it took to find the target as a measure of task difficulty. We find that only a model that biases multiple feature dimensions in a hierarchical manner can account for the data. Contrary to common assumptions, memory plays almost no role in search performance. Our model can be fit to average data of multiple subjects or to individual subjects. Small variations of a few key parameters account well for the intersubject differences. The model is compatible with neurophysiological findings of V4 and frontal eye fields (FEF) neurons and predicts the gain modulation of these cells.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The optimal treatment of Graves disease (GD) is still controversial. Surgery is one treatment option along with radioactive iodine (RAI) and antithyroid medication. In this evidence-based review, we examine four issues: (1) Is surgery better than RAI or long-term antithyroid medication? (2) What is the recommended surgical approach? (3) How does the presence of Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO) influence the role of surgery? (4) What is the role of surgery in children with GD? METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the literature using evidence-based criteria regarding these four issues. RESULTS: (1) There are no recommendations reaching any grade of evidence for which treatment to choose for adults with GD. (2) Total thyroidectomy has complication rates equal to those seen with lesser resections but it has higher cure rates and negligible recurrence rates (Level I-IV data leading to a grade A recommendation). (3) Data support surgery when severe GO is present, but RAI combined with glucocorticoids may be equally safe (Level II-IV data, grade B recommendation). The extent of thyroid resection does not influence the outcome of GO (Level II data, grade B recommendation). (4) Based on the available data, definitive treatment can be advocated for children (Level IV data, grade C recommendation) using either RAI or surgery. No recommendation can be given as to whether RAI or surgery is preferred owing to the lack of studies addressing this issue. Increased cancer risk with RAI in children below the age of 5 years supports surgery in this setting (Level I data, grade A recommendation). CONCLUSION: If surgery is considered for definitive management, evidence-based criteria support total thyroidectomy as the surgical technique of choice for GD. Available evidence also supports surgery in the presence of severe endocrine GO. Children with GD should be treated with an ablative strategy. Whether this is achieved by total thyroidectomy or RAI may still be debatable. Data on long-term cancer risk are missing or conflicting; and until RAI has proven harmless in children, we continue to recommend surgery in this group.},

	Abstract = {It is generally believed that the acuity of the peripheral visual field is too poor to allow accurate object recognition and, that to be identified, most objects need to be brought into foveal vision by using saccadic eye movements. However, most measures of form vision in the periphery have been done at eccentricities below 10 degrees and have used relatively artificial stimuli such as letters, digits and compound Gabor patterns. Little is known about how such data would apply in the case of more naturalistic stimuli. Here humans were required to categorize briefly flashed (28 ms) unmasked photographs of natural scenes (39 degrees high, and 26 degrees across) on the basis of whether or not they contained an animal. The photographs appeared randomly in nine locations across virtually the entire extent of the horizontal visual field. Accuracy was 93.3% for central vision and decreased almost linearly with increasing eccentricity (89.8% at 13 degrees, 76.1% at 44.5 degrees and 71.2% at 57.5 degrees ). Even at the most extreme eccentricity, where the images were centred at 70.5 degrees, subjects scored 60.5% correct. No evidence was found for hemispheric specialization. This level of performance was achieved despite the fact that the position of the image was unpredictable, ruling out the use of precued attention to target locations. The results demonstrate that even high-level visual tasks involving object vision can be performed using the relatively coarse information provided by the peripheral retina.},

	Abstract = {Recent anatomical, physiological, and neuroimaging findings indicate multisensory convergence at early, putatively unisensory stages of cortical processing. The objective of this study was to confirm somatosensory-auditory interaction in A1 and to define both its physiological mechanisms and its consequences for auditory information processing. Laminar current source density and multiunit activity sampled during multielectrode penetrations of primary auditory area A1 in awake macaques revealed clear somatosensory-auditory interactions, with a novel mechanism: somatosensory inputs appear to reset the phase of ongoing neuronal oscillations, so that accompanying auditory inputs arrive during an ideal, high-excitability phase, and produce amplified neuronal responses. In contrast, responses to auditory inputs arriving during the opposing low-excitability phase tend to be suppressed. Our findings underscore the instrumental role of neuronal oscillations in cortical operations. The timing and laminar profile of the multisensory interactions in A1 indicate that nonspecific thalamic systems may play a key role in the effect.},

	Abstract = {Although short-term plasticity is believed to play a fundamental role in cortical computation, empirical evidence bearing on its role during behavior is scarce. Here we looked for the signature of short-term plasticity in the fine-timescale spiking relationships of a simultaneously recorded population of physiologically identified pyramidal cells and interneurons, in the medial prefrontal cortex of the rat, in a working memory task. On broader timescales, sequentially organized and transiently active neurons reliably differentiated between different trajectories of the rat in the maze. On finer timescales, putative monosynaptic interactions reflected short-term plasticity in their dynamic and predictable modulation across various aspects of the task, beyond a statistical accounting for the effect of the neurons' co-varying firing rates. Seeking potential mechanisms for such effects, we found evidence for both firing pattern-dependent facilitation and depression, as well as for a supralinear effect of presynaptic coincidence on the firing of postsynaptic targets.},

Vision Research, 40, 1489-1506] has been a popular model for explaining the guidance of visual attention using only bottom-up information. In this paper we expand Itti and Koch's model and propose how it could be implemented by neural networks with biologically realistic dynamics. In particular, we show that by incorporating synaptic depression into the model, network activity can be normalized and competition within the feature maps can be regulated in a biologically plausible manner. Furthermore, the dynamical nature of our model permits further analysis of the time course of saliency computation, and also allows the model to calculate saliency for dynamic visual scenes. In addition to explaining the high saliency of pop-out targets in visual search tasks, our model explains attentional grab by sudden-onset stimuli, which was not accounted for by previous models.},

	Abstract = {Analysis of the statistics of image features at observers' gaze can provide insights into the mechanisms of fixation selection in humans. Using a foveated analysis framework, in which image patches were analyzed at the resolution corresponding to their eccentricity from the prior fixation, we studied the statistics of four low-level local image features: luminance, RMS contrast, and bandpass outputs of both luminance and contrast, and discovered that the image patches around human fixations had, on average, higher values of each of these features at all eccentricities than the image patches selected at random. Bandpass contrast showed the greatest difference between human and random fixations, followed by bandpass luminance, RMS contrast, and luminance. An eccentricity-based analysis showed that shorter saccades were more likely to land on patches with higher values of these features. Compared to a full-resolution analysis, foveation produced an increased difference between human and random patch ensembles for contrast and its higher-order statistics.},

	Abstract = {It is well known that selenium plays a fundamental role in regulating thyroid and other functions of the human body like reproduction, autoimmunity, glucose metabolism or bone metabolism. While for thyroid function investigation, radioimmunoassays and radioimmunometric assays both key techniques of nuclear medicine are used, for selenium measurements atomic absorption spectrometry is the method of choice. Normal thyroid gland retains high selenium concentrations even under conditions of inadequate selenium supply and expresses many of the known selenocysteine-containing proteins. Adequate selenium nutrition supports efficient thyroid hormone synthesis and metabolism and protects the thyroid gland damage by excessive iodide exposure. In regions where a combined severe iodine and selenium deficiency exist, normalization of iodine supply is mandatory before initiation of selenium supplementation in order to prevent hypothyroidism. Selenium deficiency and disturbed thyroid function may develop under conditions of special dietary regimens, such as long-term total parenteral nutrition or after inadequate nutrition in children. Some investigators suggest that selenium may be a useful adjunctive treatment for autoimmune thyroid diseases, such as Hashimoto and Graves' disease. Low serum selenium levels have been associated with higher incidence of thyroid cancer, as well as with chronic illness or lomicronw triiodothyronine syndrome. These biological actions are mediated through the expression of selenoproteins, the most important being the glutathione peroxidases, the iodothyronine deiodinases, the thioredoxine reductase and the selenoprotein P. Selenium is also associated with animal proteins. Subsequently meats and seafood are dietary sources of selenium. The ingestion of large quantities of selenium may have adverse effects. It has been shown that dietary intake of about 300 micro g of selenium daily may have a toxic effect on growth hormone and insulin like growth factor-1 metabolism, as well as in the synthesis of thyroid hormones. Main adverse effects may be anorexia, diarrhea, depression, hemorrhage, liver and kidney necrosis, blindness, ataxia and respiratory disturbances. Dermatitis and CNS deficiency have also been described. It is concluded that selenium plays an important role in regulating thyroid function, as well as in the homeostasis of thyroid hormones through the action of selenoproteins, in which it incorporates as selenocystein.},

	Abstract = {Object perception seems effortless to us, but it depends on intensive neural processing across multiple stages in ventral pathway visual cortex. Shape information at the retinal level is hopelessly complex, variable and implicit. The ventral pathway must somehow transform retinal signals into much more compact, stable and explicit representations of object shape. Recent findings highlight key aspects of this transformation: higher-order contour derivatives, structural representation in object-based coordinates, composite shape tuning dimensions, and long-term storage of object knowledge. These coding principles could help to explain our remarkable ability to perceive, distinguish, remember and understand a virtual infinity of objects.},

@article{nothdurft1999a,
	Abstract = {We studied the effects of contextual modulation in area V1 of anesthetized macaque monkeys. In 146 cells, responses to a single line over the center of the receptive field were compared with those to full texture patterns in which the center line was surrounded by similar lines at either the same orientation (uniform texture) or the orthogonal orientation (orientation contrast). On average, the responses to single lines were reduced by 42% when texture was presented in the surround. Uniform textures often produced stronger suppression (7% more, on average) so that lines with orientation contrast on average evoked larger responses than lines in uniform texture fields. This difference is correlated with perceptual differences between such stimuli, suggesting that physiological mechanisms contributing to the saliency ("popout") of textural stimuli operate, at least to some degree, even under anesthesia. Significant response modulation by the texture surround was seen in 112 cells (77%). Fifty-three cells (36%) responded differently to the two texture patterns; response preferences for orientation contrast (35 cells; 24%) were seen more often than preferences for uniform textures (18 cells; 12%). The remaining 59 cells (40%) were similarly suppressed by both texture surrounds. Detailed analysis of texture modulation revealed two major components of surround effects: (1) fast nonspecific ("general") suppression that occurred at about the same latency as excitatory responses and was found in all layers of striate cortex; and (2) differential response modulation that began about 60-70 ms after stimulus onset (about 15-20 ms after the onset of the excitatory response) and was less homogeneously distributed over cortical layers.},

@article{salazar2004a,
	Abstract = {The effects of behavioral training on early visual representations have been elusive when assessed with firing rates. Learning-induced changes in performance, however, suggest that representations should encompass early cortical stages. Here, we address the question of whether training-induced effects are pertinent to neuronal activity outside the task proper, which is a requirement if subsequent perceptional processes should profit from training. To search for a neuronal signature of training effects beyond firing rates, we measured local field potentials, multiunit and isolated spike activity during passive viewing of previously learned stimulus response associations (S+ and S-) in areas 17/18 and 21a of two alert cats. Evoked potential responses as well as gamma oscillations even during the first 200 msec were found to be stronger for S+ in both areas. Most importantly, the later parts of the response (>200 msec) not only exhibit a highly significant difference in coherent gamma oscillations for S+ and S- both within and across areas, but are also characterized by a pronounced preference in firing rate for S+ in area 21a, whereas primary cortex shows a nonsignificant trend for weaker spike responses. From these results, we conclude that training-induced plasticity occurs in adult visual cortex for behaviorally relevant stimuli by changing primarily the temporal structure of neuronal activity at early stages of cortical processing, whereas later stages of cortical processing express the increased coherence of their input in elevated firing rates.},

	Abstract = {In the Fuzzy Logical Model of Perception (FLMP) perceivers are conceptualized as forming perceptual judgments by evaluating and integrating multiple ambiguous sources of information, in an optimal manner based on relative goodness of match. This model has been tested favorably against a variety of competing theories and models. Recent extensions of the FLMP are described in this article along with empirical applications and verification, and progress in the study of speech perception by ear and eye is reviewed within this general theoretical framework. The model illuminates the differences that are observed across different languages in terms of information as opposed to information-processing. Pattern recognition of bimodal speech is representative of pattern recognition in a variety of other domains, such as emotion perception, and there are several domain-dependent reasons why multimodal presentation of audible and visible speech is particularly conducive to accurate pattern recognition. We believe that the positive outcome of this research provides a framework for the development of computer-animated agents, which can serve as language tutors and as conversational characters in other domains, easing the interaction of humans and machines.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Optimal treatment of Graves' disease in paediatric patients is still a matter of controversy. Antithyroid drugs, radioiodine and thyroidectomy are the three therapeutic options available. AIM: To report our experience of long-term medical treatment and outcome of paediatric Graves' disease. METHODS: A 5-y-long medical protocol was implemented in 20 children and adolescents with Graves' disease. All patients received antithyroid drugs as the first therapeutic option; patients who did not enter long-term remission received I(131) and/or surgery as the definitive treatment. RESULTS: The mean age at diagnosis was 12.1+/-4 y. Only two patients were males, both presenting concomitant type 1 diabetes. Mean follow-up was 13.8+/-5.5 y. Forty per cent of patients achieved long-term remission with low antithyroid drugs doses (mean treatment time: 5.4+/-1.4 y). Six patients received I(131) as definitive treatment and another six underwent surgery after completing medical treatment for 6.8+/-4.1 and 5.1+/-2 y, respectively. No patients requiring high antithyroid drugs doses to maintain euthyroidism reached long-term remission and needed I(131) and/or surgery.CONCLUSION: Implementation of a long-term antithyroid drug protocol achieved 40% long-term remissions in paediatric patients with Graves' disease. Need for maintained high doses of antithyroid drugs could be considered a predictive factor for no remission. When permanent remission was not obtained by medical treatment, I(131)and/or surgery allowed healing in all cases.},

@article{hsu2004a,
	Abstract = {We examined the neural encoding of synthetic and natural sounds by single neurons in the auditory system of male zebra finches by estimating the mutual information in the time-varying mean firing rate of the neuronal response. Using a novel parametric method for estimating mutual information with limited data, we tested the hypothesis that song and song-like synthetic sounds would be preferentially encoded relative to other complex, but non-song-like synthetic sounds. To test this hypothesis, we designed two synthetic stimuli: synthetic songs that matched the power of spectral-temporal modulations but lacked the modulation phase structure of zebra finch song and noise with uniform band-limited spectral-temporal modulations. By defining neural selectivity as relative mutual information, we found that the auditory system of songbirds showed selectivity for song-like sounds. This selectivity increased in a hierarchical manner along ascending processing stages in the auditory system. Midbrain neurons responded with highest information rates and efficiency to synthetic songs and thus were selective for the spectral-temporal modulations of song. Primary forebrain neurons showed increased information to zebra finch song and synthetic song equally over noise stimuli. Secondary forebrain neurons responded with the highest information to zebra finch song relative to other stimuli and thus were selective for its specific modulation phase relationships. We also assessed the relative contribution of three response properties to this selectivity: (1) spiking reliability, (2) rate distribution entropy, and (3) bandwidth. We found that rate distribution and bandwidth but not reliability were responsible for the higher average information rates found for song-like sounds.},

	Abstract = {During viewing of natural scenes, do low-level features guide attention, and if so, does this depend on higher-level features? To answer these questions, we studied the image category dependence of low-level feature modification effects. Subjects fixated contrast-modified regions often in natural scene images, while smaller but significant effects were observed for urban scenes and faces. Surprisingly, modifications in fractal images did not influence fixations. Further analysis revealed an inverse relationship between modification effects and higher-level, phase-dependent image features. We suggest that high- and mid-level features - such as edges, symmetries, and recursive patterns - guide attention if present. However, if the scene lacks such diagnostic properties, low-level features prevail. We posit a hierarchical framework, which combines aspects of bottom-up and top-down theories and is compatible with our data.},

	Abstract = {Retinal ganglion cells convey the visual image from the eye to the brain. They generally encode local differences in space and changes in time rather than the raw image intensity. This can be seen as a strategy of predictive coding, adapted through evolution to the average image statistics of the natural environment. Yet animals encounter many environments with visual statistics different from the average scene. Here we show that when this happens, the retina adjusts its processing dynamically. The spatio-temporal receptive fields of retinal ganglion cells change after a few seconds in a new environment. The changes are adaptive, in that the new receptive field improves predictive coding under the new image statistics. We show that a network model with plastic synapses can account for the large variety of observed adaptations.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Graves' disease is an organ-specific autoimmune disease with unknown etiology. TSHR Ab plays the most important role for the pathogenesis of Graves' disease. Recently, the role of cytokines for the pathogenesis of Graves' disease has been studied extensively. Royal jelly (RJ) is a creamy product secreted by young nurse worker bees (Apis mellifera), and it is synthesized in the hypopharyngeal and mandibular glands. RJ has been reported to have such pharmacological characteristics as antitumor, antibacterial, antihypercholesterolemic, antiallergic, antiinflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties. The major aim of the present study is to evaluate the effect of RJ on autoimmunity in peripheral lymphocyte culture and to establish the therapeutic doses. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In the first phase, lymphocyte cell isolation from four voluntary healthy subjects was performed to find the effective concentration of RJ on immunity. Serial dilutions of the RJ were prepared (0-5 mg/mL). All isolated lymphocyte cells were treated with the above diluted samples. MTT test was carried out after incubation of 72 h. In the second phase, six patients with Graves' disease, newly diagnosed by clinical and laboratory methods and admitted to my hospital and untreated were identified. RJ samples of 0 and 4 mg/mL were incubated in a culture medium for 72 h with isolated lymphocytes obtained from the patients. After incubation, MTT test in lymphocyte cell culture, Th1 cytokines IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and IL-12, and Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-10 levels by the enzyme amplified sensitivity immunoassay (EASIA) method and TSHR Ab by the radioreceptor method were determined. RESULTS: The concentration causing lymphocytes to proliferate was found to be 4 mg/mL by MTT test after incubation of 72 h in cell culture medium. Of the cytokines produced and secreted from lymphocytes, IFN-gamma increased, whereas, other cytokines decreased in RJ concentration of 4 mg/mL. Significant differences were found only for IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. IL-4 concentrations were kept near the level of significancy. Of Th1/Th2 ratios, IFN-gamma/IL-4 and IFN-gamma/IL-10 ratios also exhibited significant differences between 0 and 4 mg/mL. RJ treatment in lymphocytes from patients with Graves' disease shifted the Th1/Th2 cytokine ratio to the side of Th1 cytokine. Therefore, RJ using the treatment and establishing a remission of Graves' disease may be effective as an antithyroid drug treatment. TSHR Ab levels of lymphocyte cell culture supernatants treated with RJ showed significant decreases. Also, the result may suggest that RJ may exert an effect similar to an antithyroid drug for decreasing TSHR Ab levels. CONCLUSIONS: RJ may be effective as an immunomodulatory agent in Graves' disease.},

	Abstract = {Natural scenes, like most all natural data sets, show considerable redundancy. Although many forms of redundancy have been investigated (e.g., pixel distributions, power spectra, contour relationships, etc.), estimates of the true entropy of natural scenes have been largely considered intractable. We describe a technique for estimating the entropy and relative dimensionality of image patches based on a function we call the proximity distribution (a nearest-neighbor technique). The advantage of this function over simple statistics such as the power spectrum is that the proximity distribution is dependent on all forms of redundancy. We demonstrate that this function can be used to estimate the entropy (redundancy) of 3x3 patches of known entropy as well as 8x8 patches of Gaussian white noise, natural scenes, and noise with the same power spectrum as natural scenes. The techniques are based on assumptions regarding the intrinsic dimensionality of the data, and although the estimates depend on an extrapolation model for images larger than 3x3, we argue that this approach provides the best current estimates of the entropy and compressibility of natural-scene patches and that it provides insights into the efficiency of any coding strategy that aims to reduce redundancy. We show that the sample of 8x8 patches of natural scenes used in this study has less than half the entropy of 8x8 white noise and less than 60% of the entropy of noise with the same power spectrum. In addition, given a finite number of samples (<2(20)) drawn randomly from the space of 8x8 patches, the subspace of 8x8 natural-scene patches shows a dimensionality that depends on the sampling density and that for low densities is significantly lower dimensional than the space of 8x8 patches of white noise and noise with the same power spectrum.},

	Abstract = {Several algorithms have been proposed to characterize the spectro-temporal tuning properties of auditory neurons during the presentation of natural stimuli. Algorithms designed to work at realistic signal-to-noise levels must make some prior assumptions about tuning in order to produce accurate fits, and these priors can introduce bias into estimates of tuning. We compare a new, computationally efficient algorithm for estimating tuning properties, boosting, to a more commonly used algorithm, normalized reverse correlation. These algorithms employ the same functional model and cost function, differing only in their priors. We use both algorithms to estimate spectro-temporal tuning properties of neurons in primary auditory cortex during the presentation of continuous human speech. Models estimated using either algorithm, have similar predictive power, although fits by boosting are slightly more accurate. More strikingly, neurons characterized with boosting appear tuned to narrower spectral bandwidths and higher temporal modulation rates than when characterized with normalized reverse correlation. These differences have little impact on responses to speech, which is spectrally broadband and modulated at low rates. However, we find that models estimated by boosting also predict responses to non-speech stimuli more accurately. These findings highlight the crucial role of priors in characterizing neuronal response properties with natural stimuli.},

	Abstract = {In natural behavior, fixation patterns are tightly linked to the ongoing task. However, a critical problem for task-driven systems is dealing with unexpected stimuli. We studied the effect of unexpected potential collisions with pedestrians on the distribution of gaze of subjects walking in a virtual environment. Pedestrians on a collision course with the subject were surprisingly ineffective in evoking fixations, especially when subjects were additionally occupied with another task, suggesting that potential collisions do not automatically attract attention. However, prior fixations on pedestrians did increase collision detection performance. Additionally, the detection of potential collisions led to a short-term change in the strategy of looking at subsequent pedestrians. The overall pattern of results is consistent with the hypothesis that subjects typically rely on mechanisms that are initiated top-down to detect unexpected events such as potential collisions. For this to be effective, subjects must learn an appropriate schedule for initiating search through experience with the probabilities of environmental events.},

	Abstract = {The spatio-temporal properties of saccadic eye movements can be influenced by the cognitive demand and the characteristics of the observed scene. Probably due to its crucial role in social communication, it is argued that face perception may involve different cognitive processes compared with non-face object or scene perception. In this study, we investigated whether and how face and natural scene images can influence the patterns of visuomotor activity. We recorded monkeys' saccadic eye movements as they freely viewed monkey face and natural scene images. The face and natural scene images attracted similar number of fixations, but viewing of faces was accompanied by longer fixations compared with natural scenes. These longer fixations were dependent on the context of facial features. The duration of fixations directed at facial contours decreased when the face images were scrambled, and increased at the later stage of normal face viewing. The results suggest that face and natural scene images can generate different patterns of visuomotor activity. The extra fixation duration on faces may be correlated with the detailed analysis of facial features.},

	Abstract = {Functional models of the early visual system should predict responses not only to simple artificial stimuli but also to sequences of complex natural scenes. An ideal testbed for such models is the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). Mechanisms shaping LGN responses include the linear receptive field and two fast adaptation processes, sensitive to luminance and contrast. We propose a compact functional model for these mechanisms that operates on sequences of arbitrary images. With the same parameters that fit the firing rate responses to simple stimuli, it predicts the bulk of the firing rate responses to complex stimuli, including natural scenes. Further improvements could result by adding a spiking mechanism, possibly one capable of bursts, but not by adding mechanisms of slow adaptation. We conclude that up to the LGN the responses to natural scenes can be largely explained through insights gained with simple artificial stimuli.},

@article{blakemore1969b,
	Abstract = {1. It was found that an occipital evoked potential can be elicited in the human by moving a grating pattern without changing the mean light flux entering the eye. Prolonged viewing of a high contrast grating reduces the amplitude of the potential evoked by a low contrast grating.2. This adaptation to a grating was studied psychophysically by determining the contrast threshold before and after adaptation. There is a temporary fivefold rise in contrast threshold after exposure to a high contrast grating of the same orientation and spatial frequency.3. By determining the rise of threshold over a range of spatial frequency for a number of adapting frequencies it was found that the threshold elevation is limited to a spectrum of frequencies with a bandwidth of just over an octave at half amplitude, centred on the adapting frequency.4. The amplitude of the effect and its bandwidth are very similar for adapting spatial frequencies between 3 c/deg. and 14 c/deg. At higher frequencies the bandwidth is slightly narrower. For lower adapting frequencies the peak of the effect stays at 3 c/deg.5. These and other findings suggest that the human visual system may possess neurones selectively sensitive to spatial frequency and size. The orientational selectivity and the interocular transfer of the adaptation effect implicate the visual cortex as the site of these neurones.6. This neural system may play an essential preliminary role in the recognition of complex images and generalization for magnification.},

@article{angelucci2006a,
	Abstract = {A central question in visual neuroscience is what circuits generate the responses of neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1). V1 neurons respond best to oriented stimuli of optimal size within their receptive field (RF) center. This size tuning is contrast dependent, i.e. a neuron's optimal stimulus size measured at high contrast (the high-contrast summation RF, or hsRF) is smaller than when measured using low-contrast stimuli (the low-contrast summation RF, or lsRF). Responses to stimuli in the RF center are usually suppressed by iso-oriented stimuli in the extra-classical RF surround. Iso-orientation surround suppression is fast and long range, extending well beyond the size of V1 cells' lsRF. Geniculocortical feedforward (FF), V1 lateral and extrastriate feedback (FB) connections to V1 could all contribute to generating the RF center and surround of V1 neurons. Studies on the spatio-temporal properties and functional organization of these connections can help disclose their specific contributions to the responses of V1 cells. These studies, reviewed in this chapter, have shown that FF afferents to V1 integrate signals within the hsRF of V1 cells; V1 lateral connections are commensurate with the size of the lsRF and may, thus, underlie contrast-dependent changes in spatial summation, and modulatory effects arising from the surround region closer to the RF center (the "near" surround). The spatial and temporal properties of lateral connections cannot account for the dimensions and onset latency of modulation arising from more distant regions of the surround (the "far" surround). Inter-areal FB connections to V1, instead, are commensurate with the full spatial range of center and surround responses, and show fast conduction velocity consistent with the short onset latency of modulation arising from the "far" surround. We review data showing that a subset of FB connections terminate in a patchy fashion in V1, and show modular and orientation specificity, consistent with their proposed role in orientation-specific center-surround interactions. We propose specific mechanisms by which each connection type contributes to the RF center and surround of V1 neurons, and implement these hypotheses into a recurrent network model. We show physiological data in support of the model's predictions, revealing that modulation from the "far" surround is not always suppressive, but can be facilitatory under specific stimulus conditions.},

	Abstract = {Most of our visual experience is driven by the eye movements we produce while we fixate our gaze. In a sense, our visual system thus has a built-in contradiction: when we direct our gaze at an object of interest, our eyes are never still. Therefore the perception, physiology, and computational modeling of fixational eye movements is critical to our understanding of vision in general, and also to the understanding of the neural computations that work to overcome neural adaptation in normal subjects as well as in clinical patients. Moreover, because we are not aware of our fixational eye movements, they can also help us understand the underpinnings of visual awareness. Research in the field of fixational eye movements faded in importance for several decades during the late 20th century. However, new electrophysiological and psychophysical data have now rejuvenated the field. The last decade has brought significant advances to our understanding of the neuronal and perceptual effects of fixational eye movements, with crucial implications for neural coding, visual awareness, and perception in normal and pathological vision. This chapter will review the type of neural activity generated by fixational eye movements at different levels in the visual system, as well as the importance of fixational eye movements for visual perception in normal vision and in visual disease. Special attention will be given to microsaccades, the fastest and largest type of fixational eye movement.},

	Abstract = {Antithyroid drugs have mainly been used to obtain euthyroidism in patients with chronic hyperthyroidism, whatever the cause, and for long-term medical treatment of hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease. Endocrinologists are faced with the problem of potential side effects and a high relapse rate (30-50%) after an apparently successful treatment. Despite the use of antithyroid drugs for more than four decades, controlled prospective studies have only recently been carried out, comparing high- versus low-dose antithyroid drug treatment of Graves' disease. The present review focuses on differences in treatment regimens in various areas of the world, efficiency, side effects, and the possibility of predicting relapse at the end of antithyroid drug treatment. Several surveys have recently been taken concerning treatment strategy in various parts of the world. Despite the obvious limitations of surveys carried out by a questionnaire, these studies represent the first important efforts to analyze and compare medical strategies for the management of Graves' disease in Europe, the USA, and Japan, between 1986 and 1992. There were clear indications that American thyroidologists appear to be giving up on antithyroid drug therapy more readily and opting instead for generalized ablative treatment with radioactive iodine. In Europe, on the contrary, radioiodine remains largely limited to specific conditions, and antithyroid drugs still remain the major first-line therapy for Graves' disease. In the future, immunomodulation--either alone or in combination with antithyroid drugs--might improve the medical treatment of Graves' disease. Despite the well-known limitations of antithyroid drugs, their use is simple, safe, and advantageous; European endocrinologists thus challenge the American tendency to ablate almost all patients with radioiodine.},

	Abstract = {Our nervous system is confronted with a barrage of sensory stimuli, but neural resources are limited and not all stimuli can be processed to the same extent. Mechanisms exist to bias attention toward the particularly salient events, thereby providing a weighted representation of our environment. Our understanding of these mechanisms is still limited, but theoretical models can replicate such a weighting of sensory inputs and provide a basis for understanding the underlying principles. Here, we describe such a model for the auditory system-an auditory saliency map. We experimentally validate the model on natural acoustical scenarios, demonstrating that it reproduces human judgments of auditory saliency and predicts the detectability of salient sounds embedded in noisy backgrounds. In addition, it also predicts the natural orienting behavior of naive macaque monkeys to the same salient stimuli. The structure of the suggested model is identical to that of successfully used visual saliency maps. Hence, we conclude that saliency is determined either by implementing similar mechanisms in different unisensory pathways or by the same mechanism in multisensory areas. In any case, our results demonstrate that different primate sensory systems rely on common principles for extracting relevant sensory events.},

	Abstract = {The visual system evolved to process natural images, and the goal of visual neuroscience is to understand the computations it uses to do this. Indeed the goal of any theory of visual function is a model that will predict responses to any stimulus, including natural scenes. It has, however, recently become common to take this fundamental principle one step further: trying to use photographic or cinematographic representations of natural scenes (natural stimuli) as primary probes to explore visual computations. This approach is both challenging and controversial, and we argue that this use of natural images is so fraught with difficulty that it is not useful. Traditional methods for exploring visual computations that use artificial stimuli with carefully selected properties have been and continue to be the most effective tools for visual neuroscience. The proper use of natural stimuli is to test models based on responses to these synthetic stimuli, not to replace them.},

	Abstract = {Incoming signals from different sensory modalities are initially processed in separate brain regions. But because these different signals can arise from common events or objects in the external world, integration between them can be useful. Such integration is subject to spatial and temporal constraints, presumably because a common source is more likely for information arising from around the same place and time. This review focuses on recent neuroimaging data concerning spatial aspects of multisensory integration in the human brain. These findings indicate not only that multisensory integration involves anatomical convergence from sensory-specific ('unimodal') cortices into multisensory ('heteromodal') brain areas, but also that multisensory spatial interactions can affect even so-called 'unimodal' brain regions. Such findings call for a revision of traditional assumptions about multisensory processing in the brain.},

@article{westheimer2007a,
	Abstract = {Vision scientists long ago pointed to black and white as separate sensations and saw confirmation in the fact that in the absence of light, one perceives the visual field as gray against which the negative after-image of a bright light appeared blacker. The first recordings from optic nerve fibers in vertebrates revealed ON and OFF signals, later associated with separate streams, arising already at the synapse between receptors and bipolar cells. These can be identified anatomically and physiologically and remain distinct all the way to the lateral geniculate nucleus, whose fibers form the input to the primary visual cortex. The dichotomy has been probed by electroretinography and analyzed by means of pharmacological agents and dysfunction due to genetic causes. The bi- rather than a unidirectional nature of the retinal output has advantages in allowing small signals to remain prominent over a greater dynamic range. The two streams innervate cortical neurons in a push-pull manner, generating receptive fields with spatial sensitivity profiles featuring ON and OFF subregions. Manifestations of the dichotomy appear in a variety of simple visual discriminations where there are often profound threshold differences in patterns with same polarity as compared with mixed contrast-polarity components. But even at levels in which the spatial, contrast and color attributes have already been securely established and black and white elements participate equally, a categorical difference between blackness and whiteness of a percept persists. It is an opponency, akin to the ones in the color domain, derived from the original ON and OFF signals and subsequently bound with the other attributes to yield a feature's unitary percept.},

@article{brand2002a,
	Abstract = {Microsecond differences in the arrival time of a sound at the two ears (interaural time differences, ITDs) are the main cue for localizing low-frequency sounds in space. Traditionally, ITDs are thought to be encoded by an array of coincidence-detector neurons, receiving excitatory inputs from the two ears via axons of variable length ('delay lines'), to create a topographic map of azimuthal auditory space. Compelling evidence for the existence of such a map in the mammalian lTD detector, the medial superior olive (MSO), however, is lacking. Equally puzzling is the role of a--temporally very precise glycine--mediated inhibitory input to MSO neurons. Using in vivo recordings from the MSO of the Mongolian gerbil, we found the responses of ITD-sensitive neurons to be inconsistent with the idea of a topographic map of auditory space. Moreover, local application of glycine and its antagonist strychnine by iontophoresis (through glass pipette electrodes, by means of an electric current) revealed that precisely timed glycine-controlled inhibition is a critical part of the mechanism by which the physiologically relevant range of ITDs is encoded in the MSO. A computer model, simulating the response of a coincidence-detector neuron with bilateral excitatory inputs and a temporally precise contralateral inhibitory input, supports this conclusion.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hereditary nonautoimmune hyperthyroidism is caused by activating germline mutations in the thyrotropin receptor gene. Antithyroid treatment failed to control hyperthyroidism in most cases, so that primary thyroid ablation or 131I therapy is advocated as the preferred treatment of choice. PATIENT/METHODS: We describe a case of neonatal nonautoimmune hyperthyroidism treated with carbimazole. Molecular analysis revealed a new heterozygous point mutation (A428V) in the TSH receptor (TSHR) gene. RESULT: Antithyroid treatment was successful in controlling hyperthyroidism for the first 5.9 years of age. CONCLUSION: We conclude that carbimazole therapy is effective in treating nonautoimmune hyperthyroidism. It may be an alternative to thyroidectomy or radioiodine treatment.},

	Abstract = {Nocturnal frog species rely extensively on vocalization for reproduction. But recent studies provide evidence for an important, though long overlooked, role of visual communication. In many species, calling males exhibit a conspicuous pulsing vocal sac, a signal bearing visually important dynamic components. Here, we investigate female preference for male vocal sac coloration-a question hitherto unexplored-and male colour pattern in the European tree frog (Hyla arborea). Under nocturnal conditions, we conducted two-choice experiments involving video playbacks of calling males with identical calls and showing various naturally encountered colour signals, differing in their chromatic and brightness components. We adjusted video colours to match the frogs' visual perception, a crucial aspect not considered in previous experiments. Females prefer males with a colourful sac and a pronounced flank stripe. Both signals probably enhance male conspicuousness and facilitate detection and localization by females. This study provides the first experimental evidence of a preference for specific vocal sac spectral properties in a nocturnal anuran species. Vocal sac coloration is based on carotenoids and may convey information about male quality worthwhile for females to assess. The informative content of the flank stripe remains to be demonstrated.},

	Abstract = {Learning in neural networks is usually applied to parameters related to linear kernels and keeps the nonlinearity of the model fixed. Thus, for successful models, properties and parameters of the nonlinearity have to be specified using a priori knowledge, which often is missing. Here, we investigate adapting the nonlinearity simultaneously with the linear kernel. We use natural visual stimuli for training a simple model of the visual system. Many of the neurons converge to an energy detector matching existing models of complex cells. The overall distribution of the parameter describing the nonlinearity well matches recent physiological results. Controls with randomly shuffled natural stimuli and pink noise demonstrate that the match of simulation and experimental results depends on the higher-order statistical properties of natural stimuli.},

	Abstract = {Whether functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) allows the identification of neural drivers remains an open question of particular importance to refine physiological and neuropsychological models of the brain, and/or to understand neurophysiopathology. Here, in a rat model of absence epilepsy showing spontaneous spike-and-wave discharges originating from the first somatosensory cortex (S1BF), we performed simultaneous electroencephalographic (EEG) and fMRI measurements, and subsequent intracerebral EEG (iEEG) recordings in regions strongly activated in fMRI (S1BF, thalamus, and striatum). fMRI connectivity was determined from fMRI time series directly and from hidden state variables using a measure of Granger causality and Dynamic Causal Modelling that relates synaptic activity to fMRI. fMRI connectivity was compared to directed functional coupling estimated from iEEG using asymmetry in generalised synchronisation metrics. The neural driver of spike-and-wave discharges was estimated in S1BF from iEEG, and from fMRI only when hemodynamic effects were explicitly removed. Functional connectivity analysis applied directly on fMRI signals failed because hemodynamics varied between regions, rendering temporal precedence irrelevant. This paper provides the first experimental substantiation of the theoretical possibility to improve interregional coupling estimation from hidden neural states of fMRI. As such, it has important implications for future studies on brain connectivity using functional neuroimaging.},

	Abstract = {Barrel cortex neuronal responses adapt to changes in the statistics of complex whisker stimuli. This form of adaptation involves an adjustment in the input-output tuning functions of the neurons, such that their gain rescales depending on the range of the current stimulus distribution. Similar phenomena have been observed in other sensory systems, suggesting that adaptive adjustment of responses to ongoing stimulus statistics is an important principle of sensory function. In other systems, adaptation and gain rescaling can depend on intrinsic properties; however, in barrel cortex, whether intrinsic mechanisms can contribute to adaptation to stimulus statistics is unknown. To examine this, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of pyramidal cells in acute slices while injecting stochastic current stimuli. We induced changes in statistical context by switching across stimulus distributions. The firing rates of neurons adapted in response to changes in stimulus statistics. Adaptation depended on the form of the changes in stimulus distribution: in vivo-like adaptation occurred only for rectified stimuli that maintained neurons in a persistent state of net depolarization. Under these conditions, neurons rescaled the gain of their input-output functions according to the scale of the stimulus distribution, as observed in vivo. This stimulus-specific adaptation was caused by intrinsic properties and correlated strongly with the amplitude of calcium-dependent slow afterhyperpolarizations. Our results suggest that widely expressed intrinsic mechanisms participate in barrel cortex adaptation but that their recruitment is highly stimulus specific.},

	Abstract = {There is controversy whether simultaneous thyrostatic medication influences the outcome of radioiodine (131I) therapy in Graves' disease by reducing the absorbed energy dose of 131I when delivering a standard dose. We therefore sought to ascertain whether the outcome of ablative 131I therapy is in any way affected by simultaneous thyrostasis (carbimazole) by aiming for a constant absorbed dose of 200-250 Gy. We prospectively studied 207 patients with Graves' disease (106 with and 101 without simultaneous carbimazole at the time of 131I therapy). All patients were reexamined 3, 6, and 12 months after 131I therapy. The 101 nonthyrostatic patients showed a highly significantly greater success rate (93%) than the 106 thyrostatic patients (49%). Stepwise logistic regression demonstrated that failure was related to the administration of carbimazole during 131I therapy (P < 0.00005) and the absorbed dose (P < 0.025), but was not related to free T3, free T4, TSH receptor antibodies, or thyroid volume. The success rate was 100% in 93 nonthyrostatic patients with absorbed doses of 200 Gy or more, but was only 12.5% (1 of 8) for absorbed doses less than 200 Gy. Correlation between success and absorbed dose was significantly higher for nonthyrostatic than for thyrostatic patients (r = 0.93 vs. r = 0.24). Sixteen patients who discontinued thyrostasis 1-3 days before 131I therapy showed 94% successes. Simultaneous thyrostasis is the decisive factor against a successful 131I therapy even if the significantly reduced 131I uptake/half-life values under thyrostasis are compensated with a higher delivered dose to ensure a comparable absorbed dose, possibly due to the additionally effective radioprotective properties of carbimazole. Therefore, if clinically feasible, we recommend discontinuing thyrostasis at least 1 day before beginning 131I therapy, because even in hyperthyroid nonthyrostatic patients the success rate was 100%.},

	Abstract = {Spatial attention enhances our ability to detect stimuli at restricted regions of the visual field. This enhancement is thought to depend on the difficulty of the task being performed, but the underlying neuronal mechanisms for this dependency remain largely unknown. We found that task difficulty modulates neuronal firing rate at the earliest stages of cortical visual processing (area V1) in monkey (Macaca mulatta). These modulations were spatially specific: increasing task difficulty enhanced V1 neuronal firing rate at the focus of attention and suppressed it in regions surrounding the focus. Moreover, we found that response enhancement and suppression are mediated by distinct populations of neurons that differ in direction selectivity, spike width, interspike-interval distribution and contrast sensitivity. Our results provide strong support for center-surround models of spatial attention and suggest that task difficulty modulates the activity of specific populations of neurons in the primary visual cortex.},

	Abstract = {Many models of cortical dynamics have focused on the high-firing regime, in which neurons are driven near their maximal rate. Here we consider the responses of neurons in auditory cortex under typical low-firing rate conditions, when stimuli have not been optimized to drive neurons maximally. We used whole-cell patch-clamp recording in vivo to measure subthreshold membrane potential fluctuations in rat primary auditory cortex in both the anesthetized and awake preparations. By analyzing the subthreshold membrane potential dynamics on single trials, we made inferences about the underlying population activity. We found that, during both spontaneous and evoked responses, membrane potential was highly non-Gaussian, with dynamics consisting of occasional large excursions (sometimes tens of millivolts), much larger than the small fluctuations predicted by most random walk models that predict a Gaussian distribution of membrane potential. Thus, presynaptic inputs under these conditions are organized into quiescent periods punctuated by brief highly synchronous volleys, or "bumps." These bumps were typically so brief that they could not be well characterized as "up states" or "down states." We estimate that hundreds, perhaps thousands, of presynaptic neurons participate in the largest volleys. These dynamics suggest a computational scheme in which spike timing is controlled by concerted firing among input neurons rather than by small fluctuations in a sea of background activity.},

	Abstract = {Saccades are rapid eye movements that orient gaze toward areas of interest in the visual scene. Neural activity correlated with saccade target selection has been identified in several brain regions, including the superior colliculus (SC), but it is not known whether the SC is directly involved in target selection, or whether the SC merely receives selection-related signals from cortex in preparation for the execution of eye movements. In monkeys, we used focal reversible inactivation to test the functional contributions of the SC to target selection during visual search, and found that inactivation resulted in clear deficits. When a target appeared in the inactivated field, saccades were often misdirected to distractor stimuli. Control tasks showed that this deficit was not caused by low-level visual or motor impairments. Our results indicate that, in addition to its well-established involvement in movement execution, the SC has an important functional role in target selection.},

	Abstract = {Receptive field properties of visual cortical neurons depend on the spatiotemporal context within which the stimuli are presented. We have examined the temporal context dependence of cortical orientation tuning using dynamic visual stimuli with rapidly changing orientations. We found that tuning to the orientation of the test stimulus depended on a briefly presented preceding stimulus, with the preferred orientation shifting away from the preceding orientation. Analyses of the spatial-phase dependence of the shift showed that the effect cannot be explained by purely feedforward mechanisms, but can be accounted for by activity-dependent changes in the recurrent interactions between different orientation columns. Thus, short-term plasticity of the intracortical circuit can mediate dynamic modification of orientation tuning, which may be important for efficient visual coding.},

@article{roelfsema2006a,
	Abstract = {A fundamental task of vision is to group the image elements that belong to one object and to segregate them from other objects and the background. This review provides a conceptual framework of how perceptual grouping may be implemented in the visual cortex. According to this framework, two mechanisms are responsible for perceptual grouping: base-grouping and incremental grouping. Base-groupings are coded by single neurons tuned to multiple features, like the combination of a color and an orientation. They are computed rapidly because they reflect the selectivity of feedforward connections. However, not all conceivable feature combinations are coded by dedicated neurons. Therefore, a second, flexible form of grouping is required called incremental grouping. Incremental grouping enhances the responses of neurons coding features that are bound in perception, but it takes more time than does base-grouping because it relies also on horizontal and feedback connections. The modulation of neuronal response strength during incremental grouping has a correlate in psychology because attention is directed to those features that are labeled by the enhanced neuronal response.},

	Abstract = {The induced gamma-band EEG response (iGBR) recorded on the scalp is widely assumed to reflect synchronous neural oscillation associated with object representation, attention, memory, and consciousness. The most commonly reported EEG iGBR is a broadband transient increase in power at the gamma range approximately 200-300 ms following stimulus onset. A conspicuous feature of this iGBR is the trial-to-trial poststimulus latency variability, which has been insufficiently addressed. Here, we show, using single-trial analysis of concomitant EEG and eye tracking, that this iGBR is tightly time locked to the onset of involuntary miniature eye movements and reflects a saccadic "spike potential." The time course of the iGBR is related to an increase in the rate of saccades following a period of poststimulus saccadic inhibition. Thus, whereas neuronal gamma-band oscillations were shown conclusively with other methods, the broadband transient iGBR recorded by scalp EEG reflects properties of miniature saccade dynamics rather than neuronal oscillations.},

	Abstract = {Probing the visual system with the ensemble of signals that occur in the natural environment may reveal aspects of processing that are not evident in the neural responses to artificial stimulus sets, such as conventional bars and sinusoidal gratings. However, unsolved is the question of how to use complex natural stimulation, many aspects of which the experimenter cannot completely specify, to study neural processing. Here a method is presented to investigate the structure of a neuron's receptive field based on its response to movie clips and other stimulus ensembles. As a particular case, the technique provides an estimate of the conventional first-order receptive field of a neuron, similar to what can be obtained with other reverse-correlation schemes. This is demonstrated experimentally and with computer simulations. Our analysis also revealed that the receptive fields of both simple and complex cells had regions where image boundaries, independent of their contrast sign, would enhance or suppress the cell's response. In some cases, these signals were tuned for the orientation of the boundary. This demonstrates for the first time that it might be feasible to investigate the receptive field structure of visual neurons from their responses to natural image sequences.},

	Abstract = {Three experiments are reported in which the salience of visual stimuli is assessed by finding which of two competing peripheral stimuli elicit a saccade when both are presented simultaneously with the use of paradigm due to Love-Schoen. The first experiment shows how salience is affected by position in the visual field. A strong effect of retinal eccentricity is found which is compared with the cortical magnification factor. Additionally directional biases occur. The second experiment shows that temporal change appears to be significant in eliciting a saccade rather than any specific properties related to movement. The third experiment shows that contour at high spatial frequencies does not affect salience. An area of 4 cycles deg-1 high-contrast square-wave grating possesses the same salience as an equivalent area with identical, constant, space average luminance. Taken together, the results suggest that salience might be accountable for in terms of the activation of transient channels in the visual system.},

how come then the 5-10% of synapses originating from thalalus is powerful enough to drive the cortex? how cortex can dissociate noise from thalamus? Same argument for top-down signals which are small in number and yet functionally significant....

2/Superficial layers is a treasure of excitatory synapses. 70% of connections there are derived from other cells of the  same type. This results in a high proportion of first order recurrent connections.

Gain : change in output per input
system gain : output of system / input to system
loop gain:	 output signal that is due to feedback


feedforward gain of neurons is relatively small. i.e. small inputs do not generate output. However loop gain is high. So the recurrent connections can amplify the small input. But the question is how does it distinguish btw spontaneous activity and real input?},

	Abstract = {Memory maintenance is widely believed to involve long-term retention of the synaptic weights that are set within relevant neural circuits during learning. However, despite recent exciting technical advances, it has not yet proved possible to confirm experimentally this intuitively appealing hypothesis. Artificial neural networks offer an alternative methodology as they permit continuous monitoring of individual connection weights during learning and retention. In such models, ongoing alterations in connection weights are required if a network is to retain previously stored material while learning new information. Thus, the duration of synaptic change does not necessarily define the persistence of a memory; rather, it is likely that a regulated balance of synaptic stability and synaptic plasticity is required for optimal memory retention in real neuronal circuits.},

	Abstract = {Merging the information from different senses is essential for successful interaction with real-life situations. Indeed, sensory integration can reduce perceptual ambiguity, speed reactions, or change the qualitative sensory experience. It is widely held that integration occurs at later processing stages and mostly in higher association cortices; however, recent studies suggest that sensory convergence can occur in primary sensory cortex. A good model for early convergence proved to be the auditory cortex, which can be modulated by visual and tactile stimulation; however, given the large number and small size of auditory fields, neither human imaging nor microelectrode recordings have systematically identified which fields are susceptible to multisensory influences. To reconcile findings from human imaging with anatomical knowledge from nonhuman primates, we exploited high-resolution imaging (functional magnetic resonance imaging) of the macaque monkey to study the modulation of auditory processing by visual stimulation. Using a functional parcellation of auditory cortex, we localized modulations to individual fields. Our results demonstrate that both primary (core) and nonprimary (belt) auditory fields can be activated by the mere presentation of visual scenes. Audiovisual convergence was restricted to caudal fields [prominently the core field (primary auditory cortex) and belt fields (caudomedial field, caudolateral field, and mediomedial field)] and continued in the auditory parabelt and the superior temporal sulcus. The same fields exhibited enhancement of auditory activation by visual stimulation and showed stronger enhancement for less effective stimuli, two characteristics of sensory integration. Together, these findings reveal multisensory modulation of auditory processing prominently in caudal fields but also at the lowest stages of auditory cortical processing.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Concerns remain about risk of cancer after radioactive iodine (RAI) treatment for hyperthyroidism, especially in organs that concentrate iodine. The objective was to assess the long-term cancer risk from RAI treatment for hyperthyroidism. METHODS: A total of 2793 hyperthyroid patients treated with RAI at Tampere University Hospital between 1965 and 2002, and 2793 age- and sex-matched reference subjects were followed for an average of 10 years through the Finnish Cancer Registry. RESULTS: Cancer incidence among hyperthyroid patients treated with RAI was higher than in the population-based control group (118.9 vs 94.9 per 10,000 person-years, rate ratio [RR], 1.25; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.08-1.46). Furthermore, incidence of stomach (RR, 1.75, 95% CI: 1.00-3.14), kidney (RR, 2.32; 95% CI: 1.06-5.09), and breast (RR, 1.53; 95% CI: 1.07-2.19) cancer was increased among RAI-treated patients. The relative risk of cancer increased with higher RAI dose administered. The increase in cancer incidence was statistically significant in patients treated at the age of 50-59 (RR, 1.44; 95% CI: 1.05-1.97) or older than 70 years (RR, 1.39; 95% CI: 1.05-1.82). There was a 5-year latent period after the RAI treatment before the cancer incidence began to differ between the RAI-treated hyperthyroid patients and the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer incidence, especially cancer of the stomach, kidney, and breast, was higher in patients treated with RAI for hyperthyroidism.},

	Abstract = {When presented with simple stimuli like bars and gratings, adjacent neurons in striate cortex exhibit shared selectivity for multiple stimulus dimensions, such as orientation, direction, and spatial frequency. This has led to the idea that local averaging of neuronal responses provides a more reliable representation of stimulus properties. However, when stimulated with complex, time-varying natural scenes (i.e., movies), striate neurons exhibit highly sparse responses. This raises the question of how much response heterogeneity the local population exhibits when stimulated with movies, and how it varies with separation distance between cells. We investigated this question by simultaneously recording the responses of groups of neurons in cat striate cortex to the repeated presentation of movies using silicon probes in a multi-tetrode configuration. We found, first, that the responses of striate neurons to movies are brief (tens of milliseconds), decorrelated, and exhibit high population sparseness. Second, we found that adjacent neurons differed significantly in their peak firing rates even when they responded to the same frames of a movie. Third, pairs of adjacent neurons recorded on the same tetrodes exhibited as much heterogeneity in their responses as pairs recorded by different tetrodes. These findings demonstrate that complex natural scenes evoke highly heterogeneous responses within local populations, suggesting that response redundancy in a cortical column is substantially lower than previously thought.},

	Abstract = {A striking aspect of natural scenes is that image features such as line orientation are strongly correlated at neighboring spatial locations but not at distant locations. Thus, during the viewing of a scene, eye movements are often accompanied by a change in the orientation structure of the image. How does this behavior influence the discrimination of local features and their encoding by visual cortical neurons? Here we examined the perceived changes in orientation induced by brief exposure to oriented image patterns in monkeys and humans, and then used reverse correlation to investigate dynamic changes in neuronal sensitivity in the primary visual cortex (V1) of behaving monkeys. Whereas brief adaptation to an oriented grating impaired identification of nearby orientations by broadening orientation selectivity and changing the preferred orientation of individual V1 neurons, it actually enhanced the identification of orthogonal orientations by sharpening neuronal selectivity. Hence, successive exposure to image patches of dissimilar spatial structure enhances both the ability to discriminate local features and the encoding of these features by V1 neurons.},

	Abstract = {Experience-dependent plasticity in adult visual cortex is believed to have important roles in visual coding and perceptual learning. Here we show that repeated stimulation with movies of natural scenes induces a rapid improvement in response reliability in cat visual cortex, whereas stimulation with white noise or flashed bar stimuli does not. The improved reliability can be accounted for by a selective increase in spiking evoked by preferred stimuli, and the magnitude of improvement depends on the sparseness of the response. The increase in reliability persists for at least several minutes in the absence of further movie stimulation. During this period, spontaneous spiking activity shows detectable reverberation of the movie-evoked responses. Thus, repeated exposure to natural stimuli not only induces a rapid improvement in cortical response reliability, but also leaves a 'memory trace' in subsequent spontaneous activity.},

	Abstract = {Although it is agreed that physicochemical features of molecules determine their perceived odor, the rules governing this relationship remain unknown. A significant obstacle to such understanding is the high dimensionality of features describing both percepts and molecules. We applied a statistical method to reduce dimensionality in both odor percepts and physicochemical descriptors for a large set of molecules. We found that the primary axis of perception was odor pleasantness, and critically, that the primary axis of physicochemical properties reflected the primary axis of olfactory perception. This allowed us to predict the pleasantness of novel molecules by their physicochemical properties alone. Olfactory perception is strongly shaped by experience and learning. However, our findings suggest that olfactory pleasantness is also partially innate, corresponding to a natural axis of maximal discriminability among biologically relevant molecules.},

Such stimuli, however, often do not effectively activate high-level sensory neurons, which may be optimized to analyze natural sounds and images. We show that it is possible to overcome the simple-stimulus limitation and then use this approach to calculate the STRFs of avian auditory forebrain neurons from an ensemble of birdsongs. We find that in many cases the STRFs derived using natural sounds are strikingly different from the STRFs that we obtained using an ensemble of random tone pips. When we compare these two models by assessing their predictions of neural response to the actual data, we find that the STRFs obtained from natural sounds are superior. Our results show that the STRF model is an incomplete description of response properties of nonlinear auditory neurons, but that linear receptive fields are still useful models for understanding higher level sensory processing, as long as the STRFs are estimated from the responses to relevant complex stimuli.},

	Abstract = {To what extent can a computational model of the bottom-up visual attention predict what an observer is looking at? What is the contribution of the low-level visual features in the attention deployment? To answer these questions, a new spatio-temporal computational model is proposed. This model incorporates several visual features; therefore, a fusion algorithm is required to combine the different saliency maps (achromatic, chromatic and temporal). To quantitatively assess the model performances, eye movements were recorded while naive observers viewed natural dynamic scenes. Four completing metrics have been used. In addition, predictions from the proposed model are compared to the predictions from a state of the art model [Itti's model (Itti, L., Koch, C., {\&} Niebur, E. (1998). A model of saliency-based visual attention for rapid scene analysis. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence 20(11), 1254-1259)] and from three non-biologically plausible models (uniform, flicker and centered models). Regardless of the metric used, the proposed model shows significant improvement over the selected benchmarking models (except the centered model). Conclusions are drawn regarding both the influence of low-level visual features over time and the central bias in an eye tracking experiment.},

	Abstract = {Soy protein and isoflavones (phytoestrogens) have gained considerable attention for their potential role in improving risk factors for cardiovascular disease. This scientific advisory assesses the more recent work published on soy protein and its component isoflavones. In the majority of 22 randomized trials, isolated soy protein with isoflavones, as compared with milk or other proteins, decreased LDL cholesterol concentrations; the average effect was approximately 3%. This reduction is very small relative to the large amount of soy protein tested in these studies, averaging 50 g, about half the usual total daily protein intake. No significant effects on HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, lipoprotein(a), or blood pressure were evident. Among 19 studies of soy isoflavones, the average effect on LDL cholesterol and other lipid risk factors was nil. Soy protein and isoflavones have not been shown to lessen vasomotor symptoms of menopause, and results are mixed with regard to soy's ability to slow postmenopausal bone loss. The efficacy and safety of soy isoflavones for preventing or treating cancer of the breast, endometrium, and prostate are not established; evidence from clinical trials is meager and cautionary with regard to a possible adverse effect. For this reason, use of isoflavone supplements in food or pills is not recommended. Thus, earlier research indicating that soy protein has clinically important favorable effects as compared with other proteins has not been confirmed. In contrast, many soy products should be beneficial to cardiovascular and overall health because of their high content of polyunsaturated fats, fiber, vitamins, and minerals and low content of saturated fat.},

	Abstract = {1. The classically defined receptive field of a visual neuron is the area of visual space over which the cell responds to visual stimuli. It is well established, however, that the discharge produced by an optimal stimulus can be modulated by the presence of additional stimuli that by themselves do not produce any response. This study examines inhibitory influences that originate from areas located outside of the classical (i.e., excitatory) receptive field. Previous work has shown that for some cells the response to a properly oriented bar of light becomes attenuated when the bar extends beyond the receptive field, a phenomenon known as end-inhibition (or length tuning). Analogously, it has been shown that increasing the number of cycles of a drifting grating stimulus may also inhibit the firing of some cells, an effect known as side-inhibition (or width tuning). Very little information is available, however, about the relationship between end- and side-inhibition. We have examined the spatial organization and tuning characteristics of these inhibitory effects by recording extracellularly from single neurons in the cat's striate cortex (Area 17). 2. For each cortical neuron, length and width tuning curves were obtained with the use of rectangular patches of drifting sinusoidal gratings that have variable length and width. Results from 82 cells show that the strengths of end- and side-inhibition tend to be correlated. Most cells that exhibit clear end-inhibition also show a similar degree of side-inhibition. For these cells, the excitatory receptive field is surrounded on all sides by inhibitory zones. Some cells exhibit only end- or side-inhibition, but not both. Data for 28 binocular cells show that length and width tuning curves for the dominant and nondominant eyes tend to be closely matched. 3. We also measured tuning characteristics of end- and side-inhibition. To obtain these data, the excitatory receptive field was stimulated with a grating patch having optimal orientation, spatial frequency, and size, whereas the end- or side-inhibitory regions were stimulated with patches of gratings that had a variable parameter (such as orientation). Results show that end- and side-inhibition tend to be strongest at the orientation and spatial frequency that yield maximal excitation. However, orientation and spatial frequency tuning curves for inhibition are considerably broader than those for excitation, suggesting that inhibition is mediated by a pool of neurons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	Abstract = {The nervous system often combines visual and haptic information about object properties such that the combined estimate is more precise than with vision or haptics alone. We examined how the system determines when to combine the signals. Presumably, signals should not be combined when they come from different objects. The likelihood that signals come from different objects is highly correlated with the spatial separation between the signals, so we asked how the spatial separation between visual and haptic signals affects their combination. To do this, we first created conditions for each observer in which the effect of combination--the increase in discrimination precision with two modalities relative to performance with one modality--should be maximal. Then under these conditions, we presented visual and haptic stimuli separated by different spatial distances and compared human performance with predictions of a model that combined signals optimally. We found that discrimination precision was essentially optimal when the signals came from the same location, and that discrimination precision was poorer when the signals came from different locations. Thus, the mechanism of visual-haptic combination is specialized for signals that coincide in space.},

	Abstract = {Many current neurophysiological, psychophysical, and psychological approaches to vision rest on the idea that when we see, the brain produces an internal representation of the world. The activation of this internal representation is assumed to give rise to the experience of seeing. The problem with this kind of approach is that it leaves unexplained how the existence of such a detailed internal representation might produce visual consciousness. An alternative proposal is made here. We propose that seeing is a way of acting. It is a particular way of exploring the environment. Activity in internal representations does not generate the experience of seeing. The outside world serves as its own, external, representation. The experience of seeing occurs when the organism masters what we call the governing laws of sensorimotor contingency. The advantage of this approach is that it provides a natural and principled way of accounting for visual consciousness, and for the differences in the perceived quality of sensory experience in the different sensory modalities. Several lines of empirical evidence are brought forward in support of the theory, in particular: evidence from experiments in sensorimotor adaptation, visual "filling in," visual stability despite eye movements, change blindness, sensory substitution, and color perception.},

	Abstract = {Mechanisms supporting orientation selectivity of cat striate cortical cells were studied by stimulation with two superimposed sine-wave gratings of different orientations. One grating (base) generated a discharge of known amplitude which could be modified by the second grating (mask). Masks presented at nonoptimal orientations usually reduced the base-generated response, but the degree of reduction varied widely between cells. Cells with narrow orientation tuning tended to be more susceptible to mask presence than broadly tuned cells; similarly, simple cells generally showed more response reduction than did complex cells. The base and mask stimuli were drifted at different temporal frequencies which, in simple cells, permitted the identification of individual response components from each stimulus. This revealed that the reduction of the base response by the mask usually did not vary regularly with mask orientation, although response facilitation from the mask was orientation selective. In some sharply tuned simple cells, response reduction had clear local maxima near the limits of the cell's orientation-tuning function. Response reduction resulted from a nearly pure rightward shift of the response versus log contrast function. The lowest mask contrast yielding reduction was within 0.1-0.3 log unit of the lowest contrast effective for excitation. The temporal-frequency bandpass of the response-reduction mechanism resembled that of most cortical cells. The spatial-frequency bandpass was much broader than is typical for single cortical cells, spanning essentially the entire visual range of the cat. These findings are compatible with a model in which weak intrinsic orientation-selective excitation is enhanced in two stages: (1) control of threshold by nonorientation-selective inhibition that is continuously dependent on stimulus contrast; and (2) in the more narrowly tuned cells, orientation-selective inhibition that has local maxima serving to increase the slope of the orientation-tuning function.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To assess the self-esteem of Graves' ophthalmopathy patients in the inactive phase. METHODS: Thirty euthyroid patients were evaluated in the inactive phase of disease with age ranging from 26 to 65 years, average of 43 +/- 11,0 years, called study group and 39 individuals without Graves' ophthalmopathy with age ranging from 18 to 67 years, average of 41 +/- 13,4 years, selected from the general population called control group. To evaluate the self-esteem the Rosenberg UNIFESP/EPM self-esteem scale, applied by means of an interview, was utilized. The self-esteem scores in the two studied groups were compared by means of the non-parametric Mann-Whitey test. The same test was applied to compare the obtained scores in the Graves' ophthalmopathy group considering disease severity. RESULTS: No alteration with statistical significance in Graves' ophthalmopathy patients' self-esteem was observed (P=0.057). The study group presented, on average, lower self-esteem values when compared with the control group. There was no difference of self-esteem mild and moderate-severe patients (P=0.2710). CONCLUSION: Graves' ophthalmopathy in the inactive phase did not affect the patients' self-esteem in the group studied.},

	Abstract = {Is thalamic input to the visual cortex strong and well tuned for orientation, as predicted by Hubel and Wiesel's (1962) model of orientation selectivity in simple cells? We directly measured the size of the thalamic input to single simple cells intracellularly by combining electrical stimulation of the cortex with a briefly flashed visual stimulus. In nearby cells, the electrical stimulation evoked a long-lasting inhibition that prevented them from firing in response to the visual stimulus. The visually evoked excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) recorded during the period of cortical suppression, therefore, reflected largely the thalamic input. In 16 neurons that received monosynaptic input from the thalamus, cortical suppression left 46% of normal visual response on average (12%-86% in range). In those cells tested, this remaining visual response was as well tuned for orientation as the normal response to the visual stimulus alone. We conclude that the thalamic input to cortical simple cells with monosynaptic input from the thalamus is strong and well tuned in orientation, and that the intracortical input does not appear to sharpen orientation tuning in these cells.},

	Abstract = {Lesions of anatomical brain networks result in functional disturbances of brain systems and behavior which depend sensitively, often unpredictably, on the lesion site. The availability of whole-brain maps of structural connections within the human cerebrum and our increased understanding of the physiology and large-scale dynamics of cortical networks allow us to investigate the functional consequences of focal brain lesions in a computational model. We simulate the dynamic effects of lesions placed in different regions of the cerebral cortex by recording changes in the pattern of endogenous ("resting-state") neural activity. We find that lesions produce specific patterns of altered functional connectivity among distant regions of cortex, often affecting both cortical hemispheres. The magnitude of these dynamic effects depends on the lesion location and is partly predicted by structural network properties of the lesion site. In the model, lesions along the cortical midline and in the vicinity of the temporo-parietal junction result in large and widely distributed changes in functional connectivity, while lesions of primary sensory or motor regions remain more localized. The model suggests that dynamic lesion effects can be predicted on the basis of specific network measures of structural brain networks and that these effects may be related to known behavioral and cognitive consequences of brain lesions.},

	Abstract = {Human face-to-face communication is essentially audiovisual. Typically, people talk to us face-to-face, providing concurrent auditory and visual input. Understanding someone is easier when there is visual input, because visual cues like mouth and tongue movements provide complementary information about speech content. Here, we hypothesized that, even in the absence of visual input, the brain optimizes both auditory-only speech and speaker recognition by harvesting speaker-specific predictions and constraints from distinct visual face-processing areas. To test this hypothesis, we performed behavioral and neuroimaging experiments in two groups: subjects with a face recognition deficit (prosopagnosia) and matched controls. The results show that observing a specific person talking for 2 min improves subsequent auditory-only speech and speaker recognition for this person. In both prosopagnosics and controls, behavioral improvement in auditory-only speech recognition was based on an area typically involved in face-movement processing. Improvement in speaker recognition was only present in controls and was based on an area involved in face-identity processing. These findings challenge current unisensory models of speech processing, because they show that, in auditory-only speech, the brain exploits previously encoded audiovisual correlations to optimize communication. We suggest that this optimization is based on speaker-specific audiovisual internal models, which are used to simulate a talking face.},

	Abstract = {Autoimmune thyroid disease is the archetype for organ-specific autoimmune disorders. Progress in treating these disorders lies in improvements of our understanding of the predisposing factors responsible, the mechanisms responsible for progression of disease, and the interaction between thyroid antigens and the immune system at the level of the T cell and antibody. In common with other autoimmune diseases, genetic, environmental and endogenous factors are required in an appropriate combination to initiate thyroid autoimmunity. At present the only genetic factors which have been confirmed lie in the HLA complex and CTLA-4 or a closely linked gene. Identifying other predisposing genes will require large-scale family studies, or further insights into likely candidate genes. A number of environmental factors are known to predispose to autoimmune thyroid disease, including smoking, stress and iodine intake, while immunomodulatory treatments are revealing new pathways for disease emergence.The thyroid cell itself appears to play a major role in disease progression, interacting with the immune system through expression of a number of immunologically active molecules including HLA class I and II, adhesion molecules, cytokines, CD40 and complement regulatory proteins. New techniques, in particular phage display libraries, are providing the methods with which to identify autoantibody diversity in autoimmune thyroid disease and to provide tools for mapping autoantigenic epitopes. Application of these techniques is likely to lead to an understanding of how TSH receptor antibodies interact with the receptor to cause Graves' disease and also to the identification of novel orbital autoantigens in thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy.},

However, when the paradigm was modified to control for response bias (Experiments 2 and 3) or when response bias was eliminated by means of a forced-choice procedure (Experiment 4), no such advantage obtained. When an additional source of biasing information was eliminated by presenting the object label after the scene (Experiments 3 and 4), there was either no effect of consistency (Experiment 4) or an inconsistent object advantage (Experiment 3). These results suggest that object perception is not facilitated by consistent scene context.},

	Abstract = {Disparate sensory streams originating from a common underlying event share similar dynamics, and this plays an important part in multisensory integration. Here we investigate audiovisual binding by presenting continuously changing, temporally congruent and incongruent stimuli. Recorded EEG signals are used to quantify spectrotemporal and waveform locking of neural activity to stimulus dynamics. Spectrotemporal analysis reveals locking to visual stimulus dynamics in both a broad alpha and the beta band. The properties of these effects suggest they are a correlate of bottom-up processing in the visual system. Waveform locking reveals two cortically distinct processes that lock to visual stimulus dynamics with differing topographies and time lags relative to the stimuli. Most importantly, these are modulated in strength by the congruency of an accompanying auditory stream. In addition, the waveform locking found at occipital electrodes shows an increase over stimulus duration for visual and congruent audiovisual stimuli. Hence we argue that these effects reflect audiovisual interaction. We thus propose that spectrotemporal and waveform locking reflect different mechanisms involved in the processing of dynamic audiovisual stimuli.},

	Abstract = {We present the first cross-modal modification of visual perception which involves a phenomenological change in the quality-as opposed to a small, gradual, or quantitative change-of the percept of a non-ambiguous visual stimulus. We report a visual illusion which is induced by sound: when a single flash of light is accompanied by multiple auditory beeps, the single flash is perceived as multiple flashes. We present two experiments as well as several observations which establish that this alteration of the visual percept is due to cross-modal perceptual interactions as opposed to cognitive, attentional, or other origins. The results of the second experiment also reveal that the temporal window of these audio-visual interactions is approximately 100 ms.},

@article{bichot1996a,
	Abstract = {When examining a complex image, the eye movements of expert observers differ from those of novices; experts have learned to ignore features that are visually salient but are not relevant to the interpretation of the image. We have studied the neural basis of this form of perceptual-motor learning using monkeys that have learned to search for a visual target among distractors. Monkeys trained to search only for, say, a red stimulus among green distractors will ignore green stimuli even if they subsequently appear as targets in a complementary search array, that is, among red distractors. We recorded from neurons in the frontal eye field (FEF), a cortical area that responds to visual stimuli and controls purposive eye movements. Normally, FEF neurons do not exhibit feature selectivity, but their activity evolves to signal the target for an incipient eye movement. In monkeys trained exclusively on targets of one colour, however, FEF neurons show selectivity for stimuli of that colour. Because this selective response occurs so soon after presentation of the stimulus array, and is independent of location within the visual field, we propose that it reflects a form of experience-dependent plasticity that mediates the learning of arbitrary stimulus-response associations.},

@article{mcalpine2005a,
	Abstract = {Determining the location of a sound source requires the use of binaural hearing--information about a sound at the two ears converges onto neurones in the auditory brainstem to create a binaural representation. The main binaural cue used by many mammals to locate a sound source is the interaural time difference, or ITD. For over 50 years a single model has dominated thinking on how ITDs are processed. The Jeffress model consists of an array of coincidence detectors--binaural neurones that respond maximally to simultaneous input from each ear--innervated by a series of delay lines--axons of varying length from the two ears. The purpose of this arrangement is to create a topographic map of ITD, and hence spatial position in the horizontal plane, from the relative timing of a sound at the two ears. This model appears to be realized in the brain of the barn owl, an auditory specialist, and has been assumed to hold for mammals also. Recent investigations, however, indicate that both the means by which neural tuning for preferred ITD, and the coding strategy used by mammals to determine the location of a sound source, may be very different to barn owls and to the model proposed by Jeffress.},

	Abstract = {When dissimilar images are presented to the two eyes, they compete for perceptual dominance so that each image is visible in turn for a few seconds while the other is suppressed. Such binocular rivalry is associated with relative suppression of local, eye-based representations that can also be modulated by high-level influences such as perceptual grouping. However, it is currently unclear how early in visual processing the suppression of eye-based signals can occur. Here we use high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in conjunction with a new binocular rivalry stimulus to show that signals recorded from the human lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) exhibit eye-specific suppression during rivalry. Regions of the LGN that show strong eye-preference independently show strongly reduced activity during binocular rivalry when the stimulus presented in their preferred eye is perceptually suppressed. The human LGN is thus the earliest stage of visual processing that reflects eye-specific dominance and suppression.},

	Abstract = {Modern brain imaging techniques have now made it possible to study the neural sites and mechanisms underlying crossmodal processing in the human brain. This paper reviews positron emission tomography, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), event-related potential and magnetoencephalographic studies of crossmodal matching, the crossmodal integration of content and spatial information, and crossmodal learning. These investigations are beginning to produce some consistent findings regarding the neuronal networks involved in these distinct crossmodal operations. Increasingly, specific roles are being defined for the superior temporal sulcus, the inferior parietal sulcus, regions of frontal cortex, the insula cortex and claustrum. The precise network of brain areas implicated in any one study, however, seems to be heavily dependent on the experimental paradigms used, the nature of the information being combined and the particular combination of modalities under investigation. The different analytic strategies adopted by different groups may also be a significant factor contributing to the variability in findings. In this paper, we demonstrate the impact of computing intersections, conjunctions and interaction effects on the identification of audiovisual integration sites using existing fMRI data from our own laboratory. This exercise highlights the potential value of using statistical interaction effects to model electrophysiological responses to crossmodal stimuli in order to identify possible sites of multisensory integration in the human brain.},

	Abstract = {Thionamides, selective inhibitors of thyroid peroxidase-mediated iodination by tyrosine residues in thyroglobulin, have been effectively used in the treatment of hyperthyroidism. The choices for initial treatment of patients with Graves' disease differ in various countries, and many physicians around the world prefer to administer thionamide drugs as the first choice of treatment for patients with hyperthyroidism. Although some thyroidologists more often consider radioiodine to be the treatment of choice because of its safety and ease of administration, thionamides remain the mainstay of treatment in thyrotoxic children and adolescents and in hyperthyroid women during pregnancy, postpartum period and lactation. A recent study with continuous thionamide treatment for patients with Graves' disease shows its efficacy, safety and cost-benefit properties. Further studies of the effectiveness of continuous thionamide therapy in patients with thyrotoxicosis need to be designed and implemented to determine indications for such therapy in children, adolescents and adults with diffuse toxic goiter, in particular, in those who have had recurrence of hyperthyroidism after discontinuation of one complete course of treatment.},

On average, 7% more area of the exposed visual cortex was preferentially activated by vertical and horizontal contours than by contours at oblique angles. This anisotropy may reflect the real-world prevalence of contours in the cardinal axes and could explain the greater sensitivity of many animals to vertical and horizontal stimuli.},

	Abstract = {Sensory processing and its perception require that local information would also be available globally. Indeed, in the mammalian neocortex, local excitation spreads over large distances via the long-range horizontal connections in layer 2/3 and may spread over an entire cortical area if excitatory polysynaptic pathways are also activated. Therefore, a balance between local excitation and surround inhibition is required. Here we explore the spatiotemporal aspects of cortical depolarization and hyperpolarization of rats anesthetized with urethane. New voltage-sensitive dyes (VSDs) were used for high-resolution real-time visualization of the cortical responses to whisker deflections and cutaneous stimulations of the whisker pad. These advances facilitated imaging of ongoing activity and evoked responses even without signal averaging. We found that the motion of a single whisker evoked a cortical response exhibiting either one or three phases. During a triphasic response, there was first a cortical depolarization in a small cortical region the size of a single cortical barrel. Subsequently, this depolarization increased and spread laterally in an oval manner, preferentially along rows of the barrel field. During the second phase, the amplitude of the evoked response declined rapidly, presumably because of recurrent inhibition. Subsequently, the third phase exhibiting a depolarization rebound was observed and clear, and approximately 16 Hz oscillations were detected. Stimulus conditions revealing a net surround hyperpolarization during the second phase were also found. By using new, improved VSD, the present findings shed new light on the spatial parameters of the intricate spatiotemporal cortical interplay of inhibition and excitation.},

	Abstract = {It is well established that a range of basic visual acuities and sensitivities decline with retinal eccentricity due in part to a decline in spatial sampling in the retina. However, it is also known that not all peripheral deficits can be explained entirely by such low-level factors, suggesting a specialization of central vision for certain visual tasks. Here, we examine visual short-term memory for natural scenes and ask whether low-level factors can fully account for variations in performance across the visual field. We measure local recognition performance as a function of eccentricity for both coherent and scrambled natural scenes. We find that while spatial coherence substantially increases recognition rates for targets near fixation, the benefit of spatial coherence vanishes in the periphery. These results suggest that low-level factors cannot fully explain the decline in visual short-term memory for natural scenes in the periphery and that mechanisms selective for global configuration are largely confined to the central visual field.},

	Abstract = {Computer techniques readily extract from the brainwaves an orderly sequence of brain potentials locked in time to sound stimuli. The potentials that appear 8 to 80 msec after the stimulus resemble 3 or 4 cycles of a 40-Hz sine wave; we show here that these waves combined to form a single, stable, composite wave when the sounds are repeated at rates around 40 per sec. This phenomenon, the 40-Hz event-related potential (ERP), displays several properties of theoretical and practical interest. First, it reportedly disappears with surgical anesthesia, and it resembles similar phenomena in the visual and olfactory system, facts which suggest that adequate processing of sensory information may require cyclical brain events in the 30- to 50-Hz range. Second, latency and amplitude measurements on the 40-Hz ERP indicate it may contain useful information on the number and basilar membrane location of the auditory nerve fibers a given tone excites. Third, the response is present at sound intensities very close to normal adult thresholds for the audiometric frequencies, a fact that could have application in clinical hearing testing.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we offer an explanation for how selectivity for orientation could be produced by a model with circuitry that is based on the anatomy of V1 cortex. It is a network model of layer 4Calpha in macaque primary visual cortex (area V1). The model consists of a large number of integrate-and-fire conductance-based point neurons, both excitatory and inhibitory, which represent dynamics in a small patch of 4Calpha-1 mm(2) in lateral area-which contains four orientation hypercolumns. The physiological properties and coupling architectures of the model are derived from experimental data for layer 4Calpha of macaque. Convergent feed-forward input from many neurons of the lateral geniculate nucleus sets up an orientation preference, in a pinwheel pattern with an orientation preference singularity in the center of the pattern. Recurrent cortical connections cause the network to sharpen its selectivity. The pattern of local lateral connections is taken as isotropic, with the spatial range of monosynaptic excitation exceeding that of inhibition. The model (i) obtains sharpening, diversity in selectivity, and dynamics of orientation selectivity, each in qualitative agreement with experiment; and (ii) predicts more sharpening near orientation preference singularities.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Patients frequently express concern that treating hyperthyroidism will lead to excessive weight gain. This study aimed to determine the extent of, and risk factors for, weight gain in an unselected group of hyperthyroid patients. DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: We investigated 162 consecutive hyperthyroid patients followed for at least 6 months. Height, weight, clinical features, biochemistry and management were recorded at each clinic visit. RESULTS: Documented weight gain was 5.42 +/- 0.46 kg (mean +/- SE) and increase in BMI was 8.49 +/- 0.71%, over a mean 24.2 +/- 1.6 months. Pre-existing obesity, Graves' disease causing hyperthyroidism, weight loss before presentation and length of follow-up each independently predicted weight gain. Patients treated with thionamides or radioiodine gained a similar amount of weight (thionamides, n = 87, 5.16 +/- 0.63 kg vs. radioiodine, n = 62, 4.75 +/- 0.57 kg, P = 0.645), but patients who underwent thyroidectomy (n = 13) gained more weight (10.27 +/- 2.56 kg vs. others, P = 0.007). Development of hypothyroidism (even transiently) was associated with weight gain (never hypothyroid, n = 102, 4.57 +/- 0.52 kg, transiently hypothyroid, n = 29, 5.37 +/- 0.85 kg, on T4, n = 31, 8.06 +/- 1.42 kg, P = 0.014). This difference remained after correcting for length of follow-up. In the whole cohort, weight increased by 3.95 +/- 0.40 kg at 1 year (n = 144) to 9.91 +/- 1.62 kg after 4 years (n = 27) (P = 0.008), representing a mean weight gain of 3.66 +/- 0.44 kg/year. CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated marked weight gain after treatment of hyperthyroidism. Pre-existing obesity, a diagnosis of Graves' disease and prior weight loss independently predicted weight gain and weight continued to rise with time. Patients who became hypothyroid, despite T4 replacement, gained most weight.},

The model reconstructs high-resolution visual information from a sequence of fixations, taking into account the fall-off in resolution from the fovea to the periphery. From this framework we get a simple rule for predicting fixation sequences: after each fixation, fixate next at the location that minimizes uncertainty (maximizes information) about the stimulus. By comparing our model performance to human eye movement data and to predictions from a saliency and random model, we demonstrate that our model is best at predicting fixation locations. Modeling additional biological constraints will improve the prediction of fixation sequences. Our results suggest that information maximization is a useful principle for programming eye movements.},

@article{maldonado2008a,
	Abstract = {When inspecting visual scenes, primates perform on average four saccadic eye movements per second which implies that scene segmentation, feature binding and identification of image components is accomplished in less than 200ms. Thus, individual neurons can contribute only a small number of discharges for these complex computations, suggesting that information is encoded not only in the discharge rate but also in the timing of action potentials. While monkeys inspected natural scenes we registered with multi-electrodes from primary visual cortex, the discharges of simultaneously recorded neurons. Relating these signals to eye movements, revealed that discharge rates peaked around 90ms after fixation onset and then decreased to near baseline levels within 200ms. Unitary event analysis revealed that preceding this increase in firing, there was an episode of enhanced response synchronization during which discharges of spatially distributed cells coincided within 5ms windows significantly more often than predicted by the discharge rates. This episode started 30ms after fixation onset and ended by the time discharge rates had reached their maximum. When the animals scanned a blank screen a small change in firing rate but no excess synchronization was observed. The short latency of the stimulation related synchronization phenomena suggests a fast acting mechanism for the coordination of spike timing that may contribute to the basic operations of scene segmentation.},

	Abstract = {In this study we investigated visual attention properties of freely behaving barn owls, using a miniature wireless camera attached to their heads. The tubular eye structure of barn owls makes them ideal subjects for this research since it limits their eye movements. Video sequences recorded from the owl's point of view capture part of the visual scene as seen by the owl. Automated analysis of video sequences revealed that during an active search task, owls repeatedly and consistently direct their gaze in a way that brings objects of interest to a specific retinal location (retinal fixation area). Using a projective model that captures the geometry between the eye and the camera, we recovered the corresponding location in the recorded images (image fixation area). Recording in various types of environments (aviary, office, outdoors) revealed significant statistical differences of low level image properties at the image fixation area compared to values extracted at random image patches. These differences are in agreement with results obtained in primates in similar studies. To investigate the role of saliency and its contribution to drawing the owl's attention, we used a popular bottom-up computational model. Saliency values at the image fixation area were typically greater than at random patches, yet were only 20% out of the maximal saliency value, suggesting a top-down modulation of gaze control.},

	Abstract = {How does attention operate in natural scenes? We show that the receptive fields of inferior temporal cortex neurons that implement object representations become small and located at the fovea in complex natural scenes. This facilitates the readout of information about an object that may be reward or punishment associated, and may be the target for action. Top-down biased competition to implement attention has a much weaker effect in complex natural scenes than in otherwise blank scenes with two objects. Part of the solution to the binding problem is thus that competition and the foveal cortical magnification factor emphasize what is present at the fovea, and limit the binding problem. Part of the solution to the binding problem is that neurons respond to combinations of features present in the correct relative spatial positions. Stimulus-dependent neuronal synchrony does not appear to be quantitatively important in feature binding, and in attention, in natural visual scenes, at least in the inferior temporal visual cortex, as shown by information theoretic analyses. The perception of multiple objects in a scene is facilitated by the fact that inferior temporal visual cortex neurons have asymmetrical receptive fields with respect to the fovea in complex scenes. Computational models of this processing are described.},

	Abstract = {A crucial step in understanding the function of a neural circuit in visual processing is to know what stimulus features are represented in the spiking activity of the neurons. For neurons with complex, nonlinear response properties, characterization of feature representation requires measurement of their responses to a large ensemble of visual stimuli and an analysis technique that allows identification of relevant features in the stimuli. In the present study, we recorded the responses of complex cells in the primary visual cortex of the cat to spatiotemporal random-bar stimuli and applied spike-triggered correlation analysis of the stimulus ensemble. For each complex cell, we were able to isolate a small number of relevant features from a large number of null features in the random-bar stimuli. Using these features as visual stimuli, we found that each relevant feature excited the neuron effectively in isolation and contributed to the response additively when combined with other features. In contrast, the null features evoked little or no response in isolation and divisively suppressed the responses to relevant features. Thus, for each cortical complex cell, visual inputs can be decomposed into two distinct types of features (relevant and null), and additive and divisive interactions between these features may constitute the basic operations in visual cortical processing.},

	Abstract = {Although the family of genes encoding for olfactory receptors was identified more than 15 years ago, the difficulty of functionally expressing these receptors in an heterologous system has, with only some exceptions, rendered the receptive range of given olfactory receptors largely unknown. Furthermore, even when successfully expressed, the task of probing such a receptor with thousands of odors/ligands remains daunting. Here we provide proof of concept for a solution to this problem. Using computational methods, we tune an electronic nose to the receptive range of an olfactory receptor. We then use this electronic nose to predict the receptors' response to other odorants. Our method can be used to identify the receptive range of olfactory receptors, and can also be applied to other questions involving receptor-ligand interactions in non-olfactory settings.},

	Abstract = {Saliency models of eye guidance during scene perception suggest that attention is drawn to visually conspicuous areas having high visual salience. Despite such low-level visual processes controlling the allocation of attention, higher level information gained from scene knowledge may also control eye movements. This is supported by the findings of eye-tracking studies demonstrating that scene-inconsistent objects are often fixated earlier than their consistent counterparts. Using a change blindness paradigm, changes were made to objects that were either consistent or inconsistent with the scene and that had been measured as having high or low visual salience (according to objective measurements). Results showed that change detection speed and accuracy for objects with high visual salience did not differ from those having low visual salience. However, changes in scene-inconsistent objects were detected faster and with higher accuracy than those in scene-consistent objects for both high and low visually salient objects. We conclude that the scene-inconsistent change detection advantage is a true top-down effect and is not confounded by low-level visual factors and may indeed override such factors when viewing complex naturalistic scenes.},

	Abstract = {It has been hypothesized that mammalian sensory systems are efficient because they reduce the redundancy of natural sensory input. If correct, this theory could unify our understanding of sensory coding; here, we test its predictions for color coding in the primate primary visual cortex (V1). We apply independent component analysis (ICA) to simulated cone responses to natural scenes, obtaining a set of colored independent component (IC) filters that form a redundancy-reducing visual code. We compare IC filters with physiologically measured V1 neurons, and find great spatial similarity between IC filters and V1 simple cells. On cursory inspection, there is little chromatic similarity; however, we find that many apparent differences result from biases in the physiological measurements and ICA analysis. After correcting these biases, we find that the chromatic tuning of IC filters does indeed resemble the population of V1 neurons, supporting the redundancy-reduction hypothesis.},

@article{read2002a,
	Abstract = {Disparity-tuned cells in primary visual cortex (VI) are thought to play a significant role in the processing of stereoscopic depth. The disparity-specific responses of these neurons have been previously described by an energy model based on local, feedforward interactions. This model fails to predict the response to binocularly anticorrelated stimuli, in which images presented to left and right eyes have opposite contrasts. The original energy model predicts that anticorrelation should invert the disparity tuning curve (phase difference pi), with no change in the amplitude of the response. Experimentally, the amplitude tends to be reduced with anticorrelated stimuli and a spread of phase differences is observed, although phase differences near pi are the most common. These experimental observations could potentially reflect a modulation of the V1 signals by feedback from higher visual areas (because anticorrelated stimuli create a weaker or nonexistent stereoscopic depth sensation). This hypothesis could explain the effects on amplitude, but the spread of phase differences is harder to understand. Here, we demonstrate that changes in both amplitude and phase can be explained by a straightforward modification of the energy model that involves only local processing. Input from each eye is passed through a monocular simple cell, incorporating a threshold, before being combined at a binocular simple cell that feeds into the energy computation. Since this local feedforward model can explain the responses of complex cells to both correlated and anticorrelated stimuli, there is no need to invoke any influence of global stereoscopic matching.},

	Abstract = {In understanding and modeling brain functioning by EEG/MEG, it is not only important to be able to identify active areas but also to understand interference among different areas. The EEG/MEG signals result from the superimposition of underlying brain source activities volume conducted through the head. The effects of volume conduction produce spurious interactions in the measured signals. It is fundamental to separate true source interactions from noise and to unmix the contribution of different systems composed by interacting sources in order to understand interference mechanisms. As a prerequisite, we consider the problem of unmixing the contribution of uncorrelated sources to a measured field. This problem is equivalent to the problem of unmixing the contribution of different uncorrelated compound systems composed by interacting sources. To this end, we develop a principal component analysis-based method, namely, the source principal component analysis (sPCA), which exploits the underlying assumption of orthogonality for sources, estimated from linear inverse methods, for the extraction of essential features in signal space. We then consider the problem of demixing the contribution of correlated sources that comprise each of the compound systems identified by using sPCA. While the sPCA orthogonality assumption is sufficient to separate uncorrelated systems, it cannot separate the individual components within each system. To address that problem, we introduce the Minimum Overlap Component Analysis (MOCA), employing a pure spatial criterion to unmix pairs of correlates (or coherent) sources. The proposed methods are tested in simulations and applied to EEG data from human micro and alpha rhythms.},

	Abstract = {In this study, the authors investigated how salient visual features capture attention and facilitate detection of emotional facial expressions. In a visual search task, a target emotional face (happy, disgusted, fearful, angry, sad, or surprised) was presented in an array of neutral faces. Faster detection of happy and, to a lesser extent, surprised and disgusted faces was found both under upright and inverted display conditions. Inversion slowed down the detection of these faces less than that of others (fearful, angry, and sad). Accordingly, the detection advantage involves processing of featural rather than configural information. The facial features responsible for the detection advantage are located in the mouth rather than the eye region. Computationally modeled visual saliency predicted both attentional orienting and detection. Saliency was greatest for the faces (happy) and regions (mouth) that were fixated earlier and detected faster, and there was close correspondence between the onset of the modeled saliency peak and the time at which observers initially fixated the faces. The authors conclude that visual saliency of specific facial features--especially the smiling mouth--is responsible for facilitated initial orienting, which thus shortens detection.

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to compare the rate of hypocalcaemia after thyroid resection in patients with versus patients without Graves' Ophthalmopathy (GO). PATIENTS AND METHODS: 153 patients following thyroid surgery for Grave's disease were studied. Patients were divided into three groups according to the severity of GO at the time of surgery using the NOSPECS classification. Subgroup I comprised of 70 patients without GO, subgroup II comprised of 63 patients with moderate GO and 20 patients with severe GO were assigned to Subgroup III. Association between severe ophthalmopathy and postoperative hypocalcaemia after thyroidectomy was investigated. RESULTS: 12/70 patients complained transient and 3/70 permanent hypocalcemia within subgroup I. 14/63 patients developed transient and 4/63 patients permanent hypocalcaemia within subgroup II. There were 7/20 patients with transient and 5/20 cases with permanent hypocalcaemia in the patient group with severe GO (subgroup III). The incidence of permanent postthyroidectomy hypocalcaemia was significantly higher in the subgroup III with severe GO when compared to the subgroup I without GO (p=0.004). CONCLUSION: Although postthyroidectomy hypocalcemia seems to be a multifactorial phenomenon, this study implicates unknown role of severe GO at time of surgery in the development of hypocalcaemia after thyroid surgery for Graves' disease. Therefore, patients with GO should be considered for surgery at high volume centres specialised in thyroid and parathyroid surgery.},

	Abstract = {There are large individual differences in the self-reported ability to form vivid olfactory mental imagery. Based on such self-reports, subjects have been classified as 'bad' or 'good' imagers. The present study examined whether a differential strategy in re-enacting the olfactomotor response during imagery may explain the dissociation between 'bad' and 'good' olfactory imagers. As previously reported, odor imagery was accompanied by sniffing. Although 'bad' and 'good' olfactory imagers did not differ in their overall sniffing volume, they used different strategies when re-enacting the motor component of olfaction during imagery. Particularly, as in real perception, 'good' but not 'bad' imagers generated bigger sniffs when imagining a pleasant smell compared with an unpleasant smell (P<0.02). Furthermore, preventing sniffing significantly hampered mental imagery of pleasant odors in 'good' but not 'bad' imagers (P<0.03). Taken together, these results suggest (i) the validity of the dissociation between 'bad' and 'good' olfactory imagers as revealed by self-report; (ii) that sniffing may be a causal factor in the creation of olfactory imagery; and (iii) that sniff measurements may serve as a reliable non-verbal tool in exploring individual differences in odor imagery.},

	Abstract = {The role of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus in visual encoding remains an open question. Here, we characterize the function of tonic and burst spikes in cat LGN X-cells in signaling features of natural stimuli. A significant increase in bursting was observed during natural stimulation (relative to white noise stimulation) and was linked to the strong correlation structure of the natural scene movies. Burst responses were triggered by specific stimulus events consisting of a prolonged inhibitory stimulus, followed by an excitatory stimulus, such as the movement of an object into the receptive field. LGN responses to natural scene movies were predicted using an integrate-and-fire (IF) framework and compared with experimentally observed responses. The standard IF model successfully predicted LGN responses to natural scene movies during tonic firing, indicating a linear relationship between stimulus and response. However, the IF model typically underpredicted the LGN response during periods of bursting, indicating a nonlinear amplification of the stimulus in the actual response. The addition of a burst mechanism to the IF model was necessary to accurately predict the entire LGN response. These results suggest that LGN bursts are an important part of the neural code, providing a nonlinear amplification of stimulus features that are typical of the natural environment.},

	Abstract = {A major challenge in analyzing animal behavior is to discover some underlying simplicity in complex motor actions. Here, we show that the space of shapes adopted by the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is low dimensional, with just four dimensions accounting for 95% of the shape variance. These dimensions provide a quantitative description of worm behavior, and we partially reconstruct "equations of motion" for the dynamics in this space. These dynamics have multiple attractors, and we find that the worm visits these in a rapid and almost completely deterministic response to weak thermal stimuli. Stimulus-dependent correlations among the different modes suggest that one can generate more reliable behaviors by synchronizing stimuli to the state of the worm in shape space. We confirm this prediction, effectively "steering" the worm in real time.},

	Abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is currently the mainstay of neuroimaging in cognitive neuroscience. Advances in scanner technology, image acquisition protocols, experimental design, and analysis methods promise to push forward fMRI from mere cartography to the true study of brain organization. However, fundamental questions concerning the interpretation of fMRI data abound, as the conclusions drawn often ignore the actual limitations of the methodology. Here I give an overview of the current state of fMRI, and draw on neuroimaging and physiological data to present the current understanding of the haemodynamic signals and the constraints they impose on neuroimaging data interpretation.},

@article{kastner1999a,
	Abstract = {Responses of striate neurons to line textures were investigated in anesthetized and paralyzed adult cats. Light bars centered over the excitatory receptive field (RF) were presented with different texture surrounds composed of many similar bars. In two test series, responses of 169 neurons to textures with orientation contrast (surrounding bars orthogonal to the center bar) or motion contrast (surrounding bars moving opposite to the center bar) were compared to the responses to the corresponding uniform texture conditions (all lines parallel, coherent motion) and to the center bar alone. In the majority of neurons center bar responses were suppressed by the texture surrounds. Two main effects were found. Some neurons were generally suppressed by either texture surround. Other neurons were less suppressed by texture displaying orientation or motion (i.e. feature) contrast than by the respective uniform texture, so that their responses to orientation or motion contrast appeared to be relatively enhanced (preference for feature contrast). General suppression was obtained in 33% of neurons tested for orientation and in 19% of neurons tested for motion. Preference for orientation or motion contrast was obtained in 22% and 34% of the neurons, respectively, and was also seen in the mean response of the population. One hundred nineteen neurons were studied in both orientation and motion tests. General suppression was correlated across the orientation and motion dimension, but not preference for feature contrast. We also distinguished modulatory effects from end-zones and flanks using butterfly-configured texture patterns. Both regions contributed to the generally suppressive effects. Preference for orientation or motion contrast was not generated from either end-zones or flanks exclusively. Neurons with preference for feature contrast may form the physiological basis of the perceptual saliency of pop-out elements in line textures. If so, pop-out of motion and pop-out of orientation would be encoded in different pools of neurons at the level of striate cortex.},

	Abstract = {This experiment involved the question of where human observers look in a picture. The results indicated that observers fixate earlier, more often, and with longer durations on objects that have a low probability of appearing in a scene (e.g., an octopus in a farm scene) than on objects that have a high probability of appearing (e.g., a tractor in a farm scene). These findings (a) imply a role of cognitive factors in peripheral visual processing and (b) suggest a possible relationship between the nature of information initially acquired from a picture and subsequent recognition memory for that picture.},

	Abstract = {Sensory neuroscience seeks to understand how the brain encodes natural environments. However, neural coding has largely been studied using simplified stimuli. In order to assess whether the brain's coding strategy depends on the stimulus ensemble, we apply a new information-theoretic method that allows unbiased calculation of neural filters (receptive fields) from responses to natural scenes or other complex signals with strong multipoint correlations. In the cat primary visual cortex we compare responses to natural inputs with those to noise inputs matched for luminance and contrast. We find that neural filters adaptively change with the input ensemble so as to increase the information carried by the neural response about the filtered stimulus. Adaptation affects the spatial frequency composition of the filter, enhancing sensitivity to under-represented frequencies in agreement with optimal encoding arguments. Adaptation occurs over 40 s to many minutes, longer than most previously reported forms of adaptation.},

	Abstract = {We investigated the time-course and scalp topography of multisensory interactions between simultaneous auditory and somatosensory stimulation in humans. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded from 64 scalp electrodes while subjects were presented with auditory-alone stimulation (1000-Hz tones), somatosensory-alone stimulation (median nerve electrical pulses), and simultaneous auditory-somatosensory (AS) combined stimulation. Interaction effects were assessed by comparing the responses to combined stimulation with the algebraic sum of responses to the constituent auditory and somatosensory stimuli when they were presented alone. Spatiotemporal analysis of ERPs and scalp current density (SCD) topographies revealed AS interaction over the central/postcentral scalp which onset at approximately 50 ms post-stimulus presentation. Both the topography and timing of these interactions are consistent with multisensory integration early in the cortical processing hierarchy, in brain regions traditionally held to be unisensory.},

@article{shmuel1996a,
	Abstract = {The goal of this study was to explore the functional organization of direction of motion in cat area 18. Optical imaging was used to record the activity of populations of neurons. We found a patchy distribution of cortical regions exhibiting preference for one direction over the opposite direction of motion. The degree of clustering according to preference of direction was two to four times smaller than that observed for orientation. In general, direction preference changed smoothly along the cortical surface; however, discontinuities in the direction maps were observed. These discontinuities formed lines that separated pairs of patches with preference for opposite directions. The functional maps for direction and for orientation preference were closely related; typically, an iso-orientation patch was divided into regions that exhibited preference for opposite directions, orthogonal to the orientation. In addition, the lines of discontinuity within the direction map often connected points of singularity in the orientation map. Although the organization of both domains was related, the direction and the orientation selective responses were separable; whereas the selective response according to direction of motion was nearly independent of the length of bars used for visual stimulation, the selective response to orientation decreased significantly with decreasing length of the bars. Extensive single and multiunit electrical recordings, targeted to selected domains of the functional maps, confirmed the features revealed by optical imaging. We conclude that significant processing of direction of motion is performed early in the cat visual pathway.},

	Abstract = {Based on an information theoretical approach, we investigate feature selection processes in saccadic object and scene analysis. Saccadic eye movements of human observers are recorded for a variety of natural and artificial test images. These experimental data are used for a statistical evaluation of the fixated image regions. Analysis of second-order statistics indicates that regions with higher spatial variance have a higher probability to be fixated, but no significant differences beyond these variance effects could be found at the level of power spectra. By contrast, an investigation with higher-order statistics, as reflected in the bispectral density, yielded clear structural differences between the image regions selected by saccadic eye movements as opposed to regions selected by a random process. These results indicate that nonredundant, intrinsically two-dimensional image features like curved lines and edges, occlusions, isolated spots, etc. play an important role in the saccadic selection process which must be integrated with top-down knowledge to fully predict object and scene analysis by human observers.},

	Abstract = {We conducted electrophysiological recording and microstimulation experiments to test the hypothesis that the middle temporal visual area (MT) plays a direct role in perception of the speed of moving visual stimuli. We trained rhesus monkeys on a speed discrimination task in which monkeys chose the faster speed of two moving random dot patterns presented simultaneously in spatially segregated apertures. In electrophysiological experiments, we analyzed the activity of speed-tuned MT neurons and multiunit clusters during the discrimination task. Neural activity was correlated with the monkeys' behavioral choices on a trial-to-trial basis (choice probability), and the correlation was predicted by the speed-tuning properties of each unit. In microstimulation experiments, we activated clusters of MT neurons with homogeneous speed-tuning properties during the same speed discrimination task. In one monkey, microstimulation biased speed judgments toward the preferred speed of the stimulated neurons. Together, evidence from these two experiments suggests that MT neurons play a direct role in the perception of visual speed. Comparison of psychometric and neurometric thresholds revealed that single and multineuronal signals were, on average, considerably less sensitive than were the monkeys perceptually, suggesting that signals must be pooled across neurons to account for performance.},

@article{padmala2008a,
	Abstract = {The affective significance of a visual item is thought to lead to enhanced visual processing. However, the precise link between enhanced visual perception of emotion-laden items and increased visual responses remains poorly understood. To investigate this link, we acquired functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data while participants performed a challenging visual detection task. Grating stimuli were physically identical and differed only as a function of their previous exposure history; CS+ stimuli were initially paired with shock, whereas CS- stimuli were not. Behaviorally, subjects were both faster and more accurate during CS+ relative to CS- target detection. These behavioral results were paralleled by increases in fMRI responses across early, retinotopically organized visual cortex, which was mapped in a separate fMRI session. Logistic regression analyses revealed that trial-by-trial fluctuations in fMRI responses were closely linked to trial type, such that fMRI signal strength reliably predicted the probability of a hit trial across retinotopically organized visual cortex, including area V1. For instance, during the CS+ condition, a 0.5% signal change increased the probability of a hit from chance to 67.3-73.5% in V1-V4 (the highest increase was observed in area V1). Furthermore, across participants, differential fMRI responses to hits versus correct rejects were correlated with behavioral performance. Our findings provide a close link between increased activation in early visual cortex and improved behavioral performance as a function of the affective significance of an item.},

	Abstract = {Recent results show that humans can respond with a saccadic eye movement toward faces much faster and with less error than toward other objects. What feature information does your visual cortex need to distinguish between different objects so rapidly? In a first step, we replicated the "fast saccadic bias" toward faces. We simultaneously presented one vehicle and one face image with different contrasts and asked our subjects to saccade as fast as possible to the image with higher contrast. This was considerably easier when the target was the face. In a second step, we scrambled both images to the same extent. For one subject group, we scrambled the orientations of wavelet components (local orientations) while preserving their location. This manipulation completely abolished the face bias for the fastest saccades. For a second group, we scrambled the phases (i.e., the location) of Fourier components while preserving their orientation (i.e., the 2-D amplitude spectrum). Even when no face was visible (100% scrambling), the fastest saccades were still strongly biased toward the scrambled face image! These results suggest that the ability to rapidly saccade to faces in natural scenes depends, at least in part, on low-level information contained in the Fourier 2-D amplitude spectrum.},

	Abstract = {A novel method of chronic optical imaging based on new voltage-sensitive dyes (VSDs) was developed to facilitate the explorations of the spatial and temporal patterns underlying higher cognitive functions in the neocortex of behaving monkeys. Using this system, we were able to explore cortical dynamics, with high spatial and temporal resolution, over period of <or=1 yr from the same patch of cortex. The visual cortices of trained macaques were stained one to three times a week, and immediately after each staining session, the monkey started to perform the behavioral task, while the primary and secondary visual areas (V1 and V2) were imaged with a fast optical imaging system. Long-term repeated VSD imaging (VSDI) from the same cortical area did not disrupt the normal cortical architecture as confirmed repeatedly by optical imaging based on intrinsic signals. The spatial patterns of functional maps obtained by VSDI were essentially identical to those obtained from the same patch of cortex by imaging based on intrinsic signals. On comparing the relative amplitudes of the evoked signals and differential map obtained using these two different imaging methodologies, we found that VSDI emphasizes subthreshold activity more than imaging based on intrinsic signals, that emphasized more spiking activity. The latency of the VSD-evoked response in V1 ranged from 46 to 68 ms in the different monkeys. The amplitude of the V2 response was only 20-60% of that in V1. As expected from the anatomy, the retinotopic responses to local visual stimuli spread laterally across the cortical surface at a spreading velocity of 0.15-0.19 m/s over a larger area than that expected by the classical magnification factor, reaching its maximal anisotropic spatial extent within approximately 40 ms. We correlated the observed dynamics of cortical activation patterns with the monkey's saccadic eye movements and found that due to the slow offset of the cortical response relative to its onset, there was a short period of simultaneous activation of two distinct patches of cortex following a saccade to the visual stimulus. We also found that a saccade to a small stimulus was followed by direct transient activation of a cortical region in areas of V1 and V2, located retinotopically within the saccadic trajectory.},

	Abstract = {A long-standing conjecture in neuroscience is that aspects of cognition depend on the brain's ability to self-generate sequential neuronal activity. We found that reliably and continually changing cell assemblies in the rat hippocampus appeared not only during spatial navigation but also in the absence of changing environmental or body-derived inputs. During the delay period of a memory task, each moment in time was characterized by the activity of a particular assembly of neurons. Identical initial conditions triggered a similar assembly sequence, whereas different conditions gave rise to different sequences, thereby predicting behavioral choices, including errors. Such sequences were not formed in control (nonmemory) tasks. We hypothesize that neuronal representations, evolved for encoding distance in spatial navigation, also support episodic recall and the planning of action sequences.},

@article{aglioti1995a,
	Abstract = {Background: When we reach out to pick up an object, not only do we direct our moving limb towards the location of the object, but the opening between our fingers and thumb is scaled in flight to the object's size. Evidence obtained from patients with neurological disorders has shown that the visual processing underlying the calibration of grip aperture and other movement parameters during grasping is mediated by visual mechanisms located in the cerebral cortex that are quite distinct from those underlying the experiential perception of object size and other object features. Under appropriate conditions, such dissociations can also be observed in individuals with normal vision. Here we present evidence that the calibration of grasp is quite refractory to pictorial illusions that have large effects on perceptual judgements of size. Results We used a variation of the familiar Titchener circles illusion in which two target circles of equal size, each surrounded by a circular array of either smaller or larger circles, are presented side by side. Subjects typically report that the target circle surrounded by the array of smaller circles appears to be larger than the target surrounded by larger circles. In our test, two thin poker-chip discs were used as the target circles. The relative size of the two discs was randomly varied so that on some trials the discs appeared perceptually different but were physically equivalent in size, and on other trials they were physically different but appeared perceptually equivalent. The perceptual judgements made by the 14 subjects in our experiment were strongly affected by this size-contrast illusion. However, when asked to pick up a disc, the scaling of the subjects grip aperture (measured opto-electronically before contact with the disc) was largely determined by the true size of the target disc and not its illusory size. Conclusion It would seem that the automatic and metrically accurate calibrations required for skilled actions are mediated by visual processes that are separate from those mediating our conscious experiential perception. Earlier studies on patients with neurological deficits suggest that these two types of processing may depend on quite separate, but interacting, visual pathways in the cerebral cortex.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Attending to the spatial location or to nonspatial features of visual stimuli can modulate neuronal responses in primate visual cortex. The modulation by spatial attention changes the gain of sensory neurons and strengthens the representation of attended locations without changing neuronal selectivities such as directionality, i.e., the ratio of responses to preferred and anti-preferred directions of motion. Whether feature-based attention acts in a similar manner is unknown. RESULTS: To clarify this issue, we recorded the responses of 135 direction-selective neurons in the middle temporal area (MT) of two macaques to an unattended moving random dot pattern (the distractor) positioned inside a neuron's receptive field while the animals attended to a second moving pattern positioned in the opposite hemifield. Responses to different directions of the distractor were modulated by the same factor (approximately 12%) as long as the attended direction remained unchanged. On the other hand, systematically changing the attended direction from a neuron's preferred to its anti-preferred direction caused a systematic change of the attentional modulation from an enhancement to a suppression, increasing directionality by about 20%. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that (1) feature-based attention exerts a multiplicative modulation upon neuronal responses and that the strength of this modulation depends on the similarity between the attended feature and the cell's preferred feature, in line with the feature-similarity gain model, and (2) at the level of the neuronal population, feature-based attention increases the selectivity for attended features by increasing the responses of neurons preferring this feature value while decreasing responses of neurons tuned to the opposite feature value.},

	Abstract = {Face perception plays a crucial role in primate social communication. We have investigated the pattern of eye movements produced by rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) as they viewed images of faces. Eye positions were recorded accurately using implanted eye coils, while neutral upright, inverted and scrambled images of monkey and human faces were presented on a computer screen. The monkeys exhibited a similar eye scan pattern while viewing familiar and unfamiliar monkey face images, or while viewing monkey and human face images. No differences were observed in the distribution of viewing times, number of fixations, time into the trial of first saccade to local facial features, and the temporal and spatial characteristics of viewing patterns across the facial images. However, there was a greater probability of re-fixation of the eye region of unfamiliar faces during the first few seconds of the trial suggesting that the eyes are important for the initial encoding of identity. Indeed, the highest fixation density was found in the eye region of all the face images. The viewing duration and the number of fixations per image decreased when inverted or scrambled faces were presented. The eye region in these modified images remained the primary area of fixation. However, the number of fixations directed to the eyes decreased monotonically from the upright images through the inverted versions to the scrambled face images. Nonetheless, the eyes remain the most salient facial substructure regardless of the arrangement of other features, although the extent of salience which they attain may depend both on the low level properties of the eyes and on the global arrangement of facial features.},

	Abstract = {Studies of chromatic discrimination are typically based on homogeneously colored patches. Surfaces of natural objects, however, cannot be characterized by a single color. Instead, they have a chromatic texture, that is, a distribution of different chromaticities. Here we study chromatic discrimination for natural images and synthetic stimuli with a distribution of different chromaticities under various states of adaptation. Discrimination was measured at the adaptation point, where the mean chromaticity of the test stimuli was the same as the chromaticity of the adapting background, and away from the adaptation point. At the adaptation point, discrimination for natural objects resulted in threshold contours that were selectively elongated in a direction of color space matching the chromatic variation of the colors within the natural object. Similar effects occurred for synthetic stimuli. Away from the adaptation point, discrimination thresholds increased and threshold ellipses were elongated along the contrast axis connecting adapting color and test color. Away from the adaptation point, no significant differences between the different stimulus classes were found. The effect of the chromatic texture on discrimination seemed to be masked by the overall increase in discrimination thresholds. Our results show that discrimination of chromatic textures, either synthetic or natural, differs from that of simple uniform patches when the chromatic variation is centered at the adaptation point.},

@article{mazaheri2008a,
	Abstract = {Electrophysiological data measured by electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are widely used to investigate human brain activity in various cognitive tasks. This is typically done by characterizing event-related potentials/fields or modulations of oscillatory activity (e.g., event-related synchronization) in response to cognitively relevant stimuli. Here, we provide a link between the two phenomena. An essential component of our theory is that peaks and troughs of oscillatory activity fluctuate asymmetrically; e.g., peaks are more strongly modulated than troughs in response to stimuli. As a consequence, oscillatory brain activity will not "average out" when multiple trials are averaged. Using MEG, we demonstrate that such asymmetric amplitude fluctuations of the oscillatory alpha rhythm explain the generation of slow event-related fields. Furthermore, we provide a physiological explanation for the observed asymmetric amplitude fluctuations. In particular, slow event-related components are modulated by a wide range of cognitive tasks. Hence, our findings provide new insight into the physiological basis of cognitive modulation in event-related brain activity.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Preoperative preparation of the patient with Graves' disease (GD) is crucial to avoid intraoperative or postoperative complications associated with anesthesia or surgery. We aimed to evaluate thyroid blood flow and microvessel density in patients with GD according to antithyroid drug (ATD) treatment, preoperatively. METHOD: Forty-three patients were divided into two groups according to the ATD type. Patients in group 1 (n = 25) were treated with methimazole, whereas patients in group 2 (n = 18) were treated with propylthiouracil, preoperatively. Blood flow through the thyroid arteries was measured by color flow Doppler ultrasonography. The microvessel density (MVD) was assessed immunohistochemically and via Western blot analysis using the level of CD-34expression in thyroid tissue. RESULTS: There was a positive correlation between blood loss and thyroid volume (r(s) = 0.953, P = .0001) and blood flow (r(s) = 0.720, P = .0001) and CD-34 expression (r(s) = 0.331, P = .03) and MVD (r(s) = 0.442, P = .003). No correlation was observed between ATD type and thyroid vascularity. In patients with longer treatment duration before operation, thyroid vascularity was significantly lower relative to patients with shorter treatment durations. According to logistic regression analysis, longer treatment duration had a 142-fold decreased rate of intraoperative blood loss independent of ATD type. CONCLUSION: Preoperative ATD treatment duration may predict intraoperative blood loss during thyroidectomy. Longer treatment duration might be useful in reducing intraoperative bleeding, allowing better visualization and preservation of the nerves and parathyroid glands.},

	Abstract = {Recent research [Parkhurst, D., Law, K., {\&} Niebur, E., 2002. Modeling the role of salience in the allocation of overt visual attention. Vision Research 42 (1) (2002) 107-123] showed that a model of bottom-up visual attention can account in part for the spatial locations fixated by humans while free-viewing complex natural and artificial scenes. That study used a definition of salience based on local detectors with coarse global surround inhibition. Here, we use a similar framework to investigate the roles of several types of non-linear interactions known to exist in visual cortex, and of eccentricity-dependent processing. For each of these, we added a component to the salience model, including richer interactions among orientation-tuned units, both at spatial short range (for clutter reduction) and long range (for contour facilitation), and a detailed model of eccentricity-dependent changes in visual processing. Subjects free-viewed naturalistic and artificial images while their eye movements were recorded, and the resulting fixation locations were compared with the models' predicted salience maps. We found that the proposed interactions indeed play a significant role in the spatiotemporal deployment of attention in natural scenes; about half of the observed inter-subject variance can be explained by these different models. This suggests that attentional guidance does not depend solely on local visual features, but must also include the effects of interactions among features. As models of these interactions become more accurate in predicting behaviorally-relevant salient locations, they become useful to a range of applications in computer vision and human-machine interface design.},

First, characteristics of a disparity detector that would be useful for such processing were outlined. Then, a method was devised by which detailed binocular response data were obtained from cortical cells. In addition, a model of the disparity detector was developed that includes a plausible hierarchical arrangement of cortical cells. Data from the cells compare well with the requirements for the archetypal disparity detector and are in excellent agreement with the predictions of the model. These results demonstrate that a specific type of cortical neuron exhibits the desired characteristics of a disparity detector.},

	Abstract = {The TSH receptor (TSHr) is the autoantigen responsible for the hyperthyroidism of Graves' disease. Recent studies suggest that this receptor may also be an autoimmune target in Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO) and pretibial dermopathy (PTD). Its involvement in the pathogenesis of these conditions would help to explain the close clinical associations between hyperthyroidism, GO and PTD. TSHr has been shown to be present in normal orbital and dermal tissues and evidence supports the conviction that expression may be increased in tissues involved in GO and PTD. In the setting of Graves' disease, the expression of this antigen in connective tissues throughout the body may lead to systemic, subclinical connective tissue inflammation. Given this background, local or environmental factors such as circulating or local cytokines, gravitational dependency, anatomic constraint of the bony orbit, or trauma, may augment clinical disease involvement within the orbit and pretibial skin. Alternately, locally enhanced expression of this protein at the sites of clinical disease may not be directly involved in pathogenesis, but could be secondary to the ongoing process, and nonetheless important in disease progression.},

We report here that the LOtv is also activated in sighted and blind humans who recognize objects by extracting shape information from visual-to-auditory sensory substitution soundscapes. Recognizing objects by their typical sounds or learning to associate specific soundscapes with specific objects do not activate this region. This suggests that LOtv is driven by the presence of shape information.},

	Abstract = {Development of the selective response properties that define columns in sensory cortex is thought to begin early in cortical maturation, without the need for experience. We investigated the development of direction selectivity in ferret visual cortex using optical imaging and electrophysiological techniques and found an exception to this view. Unlike orientation selectivity and ocular dominance, direction selectivity was not detected at eye opening. Direction selectivity emerged several days later and strengthened to adult levels over the following 2 weeks. Visual experience was essential for this process, as shown by the absence of direction selectivity in dark-reared ferrets. The impairment persisted in dark-reared ferrets that were given experience after this period, despite the recovery of response amplitude, preference and bandwidth for stimulus orientation, spatial and temporal frequency, and contrast. Visual experience in early postnatal life plays a necessary and unique role in the development of cortical direction selectivity.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of obesity following therapy for hyperthyroidism and to assess the contributing factors associated with an undesirable weight gain. DESIGN: A retrospective analysis was undertaken of clinical records for 160 hyperthyroid patients attending an endocrine clinic in Bloemfontein (1994-2001). RESULTS: Of the 160 patients, 143 had Graves' disease and 17 patients had multinodular goitre. Most of our patients (N = 147) were treated with radioiodine, 10 patients with carbimazole and 3 patients had thyroidectomy. The median weight gain 6 months after therapy was 5.0 kg, after 12 months 9.0 kg, and after 24 months 12 kg, whereafter body mass stabilised. Before therapy 27.5% of patients had a body mass index (BMI) of < 22 kg/m2, 29.4% were overweight (BMI > 25 kg/m2) and 19.3% were obese (BMI > 30 kg/m2). Two years after treatment only 8.7% of patients had a BMI of < 22 kg/m2, 27.5% had a BMI > 25 kg/m2, and 51.3% had become obese. The main factors associated with weight gain 24 months after therapy were poor control of thyroid function on replacement therapy, diagnosis of Graves' disease and need for thyroxine replacement. CONCLUSION: This study has shown a large increase (32%) in the prevalence of obesity following treatment for hyperthyroidism. The main weight gain was during the first 2 years after therapy. The main factors contributing to excessive weight gain were need for replacement therapy and poor control of thyroid function.},

	Abstract = {Different cortical areas are linked reciprocally via forward and feedback connections. Forward connections are involved in the representation of retinal images, whereas feedback pathways may play a role in the selection and interpretation of visual information. To examine the synaptic mechanisms of forward and feedback connections between primary and secondary visual cortical areas directly, we have performed intracellular recordings in slices of rat visual cortex. Irrespective of stimulus intensity and membrane potential, 78% (45/58) of the cells in striate cortex activated by feedback input showed monosynaptic responses that were depolarizing only, and inhibitory inputs were evident merely as a slight acceleration in the decay of EPSPs. In contrast, in 89% (17/19) of the cells, stimulation of forward input evoked monosynaptic excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs), followed by disynaptic, hyperpolarizing inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs). EPSPs followed by IPSPs also were recorded after stimulation of local connections within primary visual cortex (92%, 12/13) and after activation of thalamocortical input (91%, 10/11). These results suggest that the synaptic organization of feedback connections are distinct from forward, local, and thalamocortical circuits. The findings further indicate that intracortical back projections exert modulatory influences via synaptic mechanisms in which weak inhibitory input is strongly dominated by excitation.},

	Abstract = {Watching a speaker's lips during face-to-face conversation (lipreading) markedly improves speech perception, particularly in noisy conditions. With functional magnetic resonance imaging it was found that these linguistic visual cues are sufficient to activate auditory cortex in normal hearing individuals in the absence of auditory speech sounds. Two further experiments suggest that these auditory cortical areas are not engaged when an individual is viewing nonlinguistic facial movements but appear to be activated by silent meaningless speechlike movements (pseudospeech). This supports psycholinguistic evidence that seen speech influences the perception of heard speech at a prelexical stage.},

	Abstract = {When observing art the viewer's understanding results from the interplay between the marks made on the surface by the artist and the viewer's perception and knowledge of it. Here we use a novel set of stimuli to dissociate the influences of the marks on the surface and the viewer's perceptual experience upon the manner in which the viewer inspects art. Our stimuli provide the opportunity to study situations in which (1) the same visual stimulus can give rise to two different perceptual experiences in the viewer, and (2) the visual stimuli differ but give rise to the same perceptual experience in the viewer. We find that oculomotor behaviour changes when the perceptual experience changes. Oculomotor behaviour also differs when the viewer's perceptual experience is the same but the visual stimulus is different. The methodology used and insights gained from this study offer a first step toward an experimental exploration of the relative influences of the artist's creation and viewer's perception when viewing art and also toward a better understanding of the principles of composition in portraiture.},

@article{macevoy2008a,
	Abstract = {In the present study, we examined the way that scene complexity and saccades combine to sculpt the temporal response patterns of V1 neurons. To bridge the gap between conventional and free viewing experiments, we compared responses of neurons across four paradigms ranging from less to more natural. An optimal bar stimulus was either flashed into a receptive field (RF) or brought into it via saccade and was embedded in either a natural scene or a uniform gray background. Responses to a flashed bar tended to be higher with a uniform rather than natural background. The most novel result reported here is that responses evoked by stimuli brought into the RF via saccades were enhanced compared with the same stimuli flashed during steady fixation. No single factor appears to account entirely for this surprising effect, but there were small contributions from fixational saccades and residual activity carried over from the previous fixation. We also found a negative correlation with cells' response "history" in that a larger response on one fixation was associated with a lower response on the subsequent fixation. The effects of the natural background and saccades exhibited a significant nonlinear interaction with the suppressive effects of the natural background less for stimuli entering RFs with saccades. Together, these results suggest that even responses to standard optimal stimuli are difficult to predict under conditions similar to natural vision, and further demonstrate the importance of naturalistic experimental paradigms to the study of visual processing in V1.},

	Abstract = {A Bayesian system identification technique was used to determine which image characteristics predict where people fixate when viewing natural images. More specifically an estimate was derived for the mapping between image characteristics at a given location and the probability that this location was fixated. Using a large database of eye fixations to natural images, we determined the most probable (a posteriori) model of this mapping. From a set of candidate feature maps consisting of edge, contrast and luminance maps (at two different spatial scales), fixation probability was dominated by high spatial frequency edge information. The best model applied compressive non-linearity to the high frequency edge detecting filters (approximately a square root). Both low spatial frequency edges and contrast had weaker, but inhibitory, effects. The contributions of the other maps were so small as to be behaviourally irrelevant. This Bayesian method identifies not only the relevant weighting of the different maps, but how this weighting varies as a function of distance from the point of fixation. It was found that rather than centre surround inhibition, the weightings simply averaged over an area of about 2 degrees.},

@article{kobe2008a,
	Abstract = {AIM: This study was performed to determine the results of ablative radioiodine therapy (RIT) when the achieved dose in the thyroid was above 200 Gy and to characterize predictive factors for treatment outcome. PATIENTS, METHODS: A total of 571 consecutive patients were observed for 12 months between July 2001 and June 2004. Inclusion criteria were a confirmed diagnosis Graves' disease, compensation of hyperthyroidism and withdrawal of antithyroid drugs two days before preliminary radioiodine-testing and RIT. The intended dose was 250 Gy and the therapeutically achieved dose was calculated from serial uptake measurements. The end-point measure was thyroid function 12 months after RIT; success was defined as elimination of hyperthyroidism. The relation between success rate and the achieved dose, thyroid volume, age and sex of patients, TSH- and TRAb-values and presence of ophthalmopathy was analysed. RESULTS: Relief from hyperthyroidism was achieved in 96% of patients who received more than 200 Gy, even for thyroid volumes >40 ml. The success of ablative RIT was not influenced by age or sex of patients, or by TSH- or TRAb values or concomitant ophthalmopathy. The mean achieved dose in the thyroid was 298 Gy with a standard deviation of 74.6 Gy. CONCLUSION: To achieve a dose of over 200 Gy with the above standard deviation, we recommend calculating an intended dose of 250 Gy and using a dosimetric approach with early and late uptake values in the radioiodine test, to allow early therapeutic intervention should the posttherapeutic thyroid dose fall unexpectedly below 200 Gy.},

Stimulation of the nonclassical receptive field increases the selectivity and sparseness of individual V1 neurons, increases the sparseness of the population response distribution, and strongly decorrelates the responses of neuron pairs. These effects are due to both excitatory and suppressive modulation of the classical receptive field by the nonclassical receptive field and do not depend critically on the spatiotemporal structure of the stimuli. During natural vision, the classical and nonclassical receptive fields function together to form a sparse representation of the visual world. This sparse code may be computationally efficient for both early vision and higher visual processing.},

	Abstract = {Psychophysical and physiological evidence indicates that the visual system of primates and humans has evolved a specialized processing focus moving across the visual scene. This study addresses the question of how simple networks of neuron-like elements can account for a variety of phenomena associated with this shift of selective visual attention. Specifically, we propose the following: (1) A number of elementary features, such as color, orientation, direction of movement, disparity etc. are represented in parallel in different topographical maps, called the early representation. (2) There exists a selective mapping from the early topographic representation into a more central non-topographic representation, such that at any instant the central representation contains the properties of only a single location in the visual scene, the selected location. We suggest that this mapping is the principal expression of early selective visual attention. One function of selective attention is to fuse information from different maps into one coherent whole. (3) Certain selection rules determine which locations will be mapped into the central representation. The major rule, using the conspicuity of locations in the early representation, is implemented using a so-called Winner-Take-All network. Inhibiting the selected location in this network causes an automatic shift towards the next most conspicious location. Additional rules are proximity and similarity preferences. We discuss how these rules can be implemented in neuron-like networks and suggest a possible role for the extensive back-projection from the visual cortex to the LGN.},

	Abstract = {It has been proposed that facial expression production originates in sensory regulation. Here we demonstrate that facial expressions of fear are configured to enhance sensory acquisition. A statistical model of expression appearance revealed that fear and disgust expressions have opposite shape and surface reflectance features. We hypothesized that this reflects a fundamental antagonism serving to augment versus diminish sensory exposure. In keeping with this hypothesis, when subjects posed expressions of fear, they had a subjectively larger visual field, faster eye movements during target localization and an increase in nasal volume and air velocity during inspiration. The opposite pattern was found for disgust. Fear may therefore work to enhance perception, whereas disgust dampens it. These convergent results provide support for the Darwinian hypothesis that facial expressions are not arbitrary configurations for social communication, but rather, expressions may have originated in altering the sensory interface with the physical world.},

	Abstract = {Motor learning can be defined as changing performance so as to optimize some function of the task, such as accuracy. The measure of accuracy that is optimized is called a loss function and specifies how the CNS rates the relative success or cost of a particular movement outcome. Models of pointing in sensorimotor control and learning usually assume a quadratic loss function in which the mean squared error is minimized. Here we develop a technique for measuring the loss associated with errors. Subjects were required to perform a task while we experimentally controlled the skewness of the distribution of errors they experienced. Based on the change in the subjects' average performance, we infer the loss function. We show that people use a loss function in which the cost increases approximately quadratically with error for small errors and significantly less than quadratically for large errors. The system is thus robust to outliers. This suggests that models of sensorimotor control and learning that have assumed minimizing squared error are a good approximation but tend to penalize large errors excessively.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, a computer-based prototype device was designed based on an economical noninvasive system that could detect and display the relative skin temperature variations present in human patients suffering from thyroid disorders. Such a system could be used to augment the normal procedures followed by the physician in diagnosing the thyroid to detect areas of hyperactivity within the gland. Because a hyperactive nodule is a center of increased blood flow and chemical activity, it might be also a center of heat production that is detectable by thermal sensing. This paper also presents a finite-element analysis (FEA) of a hot thyroid nodule that is used for investigating the temperature distribution in conjunction with the prototype. The instrumentation model built was based on actual dimensional human model for thyroid nodules obtained from various patients. A software program was written in Visual Basic to detect the temperature distribution around the hot spot. The software also incorporates means to minimize the thermal noise associated with the body temperature. The FEA utilizes the same boundary values used in the practical settings. This includes initial values of temperatures for the hot spot and its surroundings. The results of the finite-element simulation assisted in the selection of the solid state sensors that were used in the instrumentation of the thermographic system. The selected sensors were calibrated for their functionality and dynamic performance according to the specifications. The new noninvasive diagnostic technique was applied to patients having Graves' diseases at the Indiana University (IU) Hospital, and compared with the existing scheme that utilizes I Scan. The results of the new diagnostic method were in good agreement with the current existing method.},

@article{land2001a,
	Abstract = {We studied the eye movements of a racing driver during high-speed practice to see whether he took in visual information in a different way from a normal driver on a winding road [1, 2]. We found that, when cornering, he spent most of the time looking close to, but not exactly at, the tangent points on the inside edges of the bends. Each bend was treated slightly differently, and there was a highly repeatable pattern to the way the track edge was viewed throughout each bend. We also found a very close relationship between the driver's head direction and the rate of rotation of the car 1 s later. We interpret these observations as indicating that the driver's gaze is not driven directly by tangent point location, as it is in ordinary driving. Instead, we propose that his head direction is driven by the same information that he uses to control steering and speed, namely his knowledge of the track and his racing line round it. If he directs his head at an angle proportional to his estimate of car rotation speed, this will automatically bring his head roughly into line with the tangent points of the bends. From this standardized position, he can use the expected movements of the tangent points in his field of view to verify, and if necessary modify, his racing line during the following second.},

	Abstract = {When two brief flashes presented in rapid succession (<100 ms apart) are paired with a single auditory stimulus, subjects often report perceiving only a single flash [Andersen, T.S., Tiippana, K., Sams, M., 2004. Factors influencing audiovisual fission and fusion illusions. Brain Res. Cogn. Brain Res. 21, 301-308; Shams, L., Iwaki, S., Chawla, A., Bhattacharya, J., 2005a. Early modulation of visual cortex by sound: an MEG study. Neurosci. Lett. 378, 76-81, Shams, L., Ma, W.J., Beierholm, U., 2005b. Sound-induced flash illusion as an optimal percept. Neuroreport 16, 1923-1927]. We used event-related potentials (ERPs) to investigate the timing and localization of the cortical processes that underlie this sound induced flash fusion, which is complementary to the sound-induced extra flash illusion that we analyzed previously [Mishra, J., Martinez, A., Sejnowski, T.J. and Hillyard, S.A., Early cross-modal interactions in auditory and visual cortex underlie a sound-induced visual illusion. J. Neurosci. 27 (2007) 4120-4131]. The difference ERP that represented the cross-modal interaction between the visual (two flashes) and auditory (one sound) constituents of the bimodal stimulus revealed a positive component elicited 160-190 ms after stimulus onset, which was markedly attenuated in subjects who did not perceive the second flash. This component, previously designated as PD180 [Mishra, J., Martinez, A., Sejnowski, T.J. and Hillyard, S.A., Early cross-modal interactions in auditory and visual cortex underlie a sound-induced visual illusion. J. Neurosci. 27 (2007) 4120-4131], was localized by dipole modeling to polysensory superior temporal cortex. PD180 was found to covary in amplitude across subjects with the visual evoked N1 component (148-184 ms), suggesting that inter-individual differences in perceiving the illusion are based at least in part on differences in visual processing. A trial-by-trial analysis found that the PD180 as well as a subsequent modulation in visual cortex at 228-248 ms was diminished on trials when the two flashes were perceived as one relative to trials when two flashes were correctly reported. These results suggest that the sound induced flash fusion is based on an interaction between polysensory and visual cortical areas.},

	Abstract = {Many neurons in the superior colliculus (SC) integrate sensory information from multiple modalities, giving rise to significant response enhancements. Although enhanced multisensory responses have been shown to depend on the spatial and temporal relationships of the stimuli as well as on their relative effectiveness, these factors alone do not appear sufficient to account for the substantial heterogeneity in the magnitude of the multisensory products that have been observed. Toward this end, the present experiments have revealed that there are substantial differences in the operations used by different multisensory SC neurons to integrate their cross-modal inputs, suggesting that intrinsic differences in these neurons may also play an important deterministic role in multisensory integration. In addition, the integrative operation employed by a given neuron was found to be well correlated with the neuron's dynamic range. In total, four categories of SC neurons were identified based on how their multisensory responses changed relative to the predicted addition of the two unisensory inputs as stimulus effectiveness was altered. Despite the presence of these categories, a general rule was that the most robust multisensory enhancements were seen with combinations of the least effective unisensory stimuli. Together, these results provide a better quantitative picture of the integrative operations performed by multisensory SC neurons and suggest mechanistic differences in the way in which these neurons synthesize cross-modal information.},

@article{toth1996a,
	Abstract = {Neurons in primary visual cortex (area 17) respond vigorously to oriented stimuli within their receptive fields; however, stimuli presented outside the suprathreshold receptive field can also influence their responses. Here we describe a fundamental feature of the spatial interaction between suprathreshold center and subthreshold surround. By optical imaging of intrinsic signals in area 17 in response to a stimulus border, we show that a given stimulus generates activity primarily in iso-orientation domains, which extend for several millimeters across the cortical surface in a manner consistent with the architecture of long-range horizontal connections in area 17. By mapping the receptive fields of single neurons and imaging responses from the same cortex to stimuli that include or exclude the aggregate suprathreshold receptive field, we show that intrinsic signals strongly reveal the subthreshold surround contribution. Optical imaging and single-unit recording both demonstrate that the relative contrast of center and surround stimuli regulates whether surround interactions are facilitative or suppressive: the same surround stimulus facilitates responses when center contrast is low, but suppresses responses when center contrast is high. Such spatial interactions in area 17 are ideally suited to contribute to phenomena commonly regarded as part of "higher-level" visual processing, such as perceptual "popout" and "filling-in."},

@article{tsatsoulis2006a,
	Abstract = {During stress, activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the sympathoadrenal system leads to increased secretion of glucocorticoids and catecholamines, respectively, in order to maintain homeostasis. Recent evidence suggests that stress hormones, acting on antigen-presenting immune cells, may influence the differentiation of bipotential T helper (Th) cells away from Th1 and toward a Th2 phenotype. This results in suppression of cellular immunity and potentiation of humoral immunity. Thyroid autoimmunity is clinically expressed as Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) and its variants (sporadic or postpartum thyroiditis) or as Grave's disease (GD). The different phenotypic expression of thyroid autoimmunity is largely dependent on the balance of Th1 versus Th2 immune response. A predominantly Th1-mediated immune activity may promote apoptotic pathways on thyroid follicular cells leading to thyroid cell destruction and HT. Conversely, predominance of Th2-mediated immune response may induce antigen-specific B lymphocytes to produce anti-TSH receptor (TSHr) antibodies causing GD. The weight of evidence from epidemiological and case-control studies supports an association between stress and GD. On the other hand, there is little information available on the effect of stress on HT, but there is evidence for an increase in postpartum thyroiditis, following the cellular immune suppressive effect of pregnancy. Whether stress has a causative effect on GD remains elusive. Circumstantial evidence supports the hypothesis that stress may influence the clinical expression of thyroid autoimmunity in susceptible individuals favoring the development of GD by shifting the Th1-Th2 balance away for Th1 and toward Th2. Conversely, recovery from stress or the immune suppressive effect of pregnancy may induce a Th2 to Th1 "return shift" leading to autoimmune (sporadic) or postpartum thyroiditis, respectively.},

	Abstract = {Prior exposure to a moving grating of high contrast led to a substantial and persistent reduction in the contrast sensitivity of neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of macaque. This slow contrast adaptation was potent in all magnocellular (M) cells but essentially absent in parvocellular (P) cells and neurons that received input from S cones. Simultaneous recordings of M cells and the potentials of ganglion cells driving them showed that adaptation originated in ganglion cells. As expected from the spatiotemporal tuning of M cells, adaptation was broadly tuned for spatial frequency and lacked orientation selectivity. Adaptation could be induced by high temporal frequencies to which cortical neurons do not respond, but not by low temporal frequencies that can strongly adapt cortical neurons. Our observations confirm that contrast adaptation occurs at multiple levels in the visual system, and they provide a new way to reveal the function and perceptual significance of the M pathway.},

@article{pillow2008a,
	Abstract = {Statistical dependencies in the responses of sensory neurons govern both the amount of stimulus information conveyed and the means by which downstream neurons can extract it. Although a variety of measurements indicate the existence of such dependencies, their origin and importance for neural coding are poorly understood. Here we analyse the functional significance of correlated firing in a complete population of macaque parasol retinal ganglion cells using a model of multi-neuron spike responses. The model, with parameters fit directly to physiological data, simultaneously captures both the stimulus dependence and detailed spatio-temporal correlations in population responses, and provides two insights into the structure of the neural code. First, neural encoding at the population level is less noisy than one would expect from the variability of individual neurons: spike times are more precise, and can be predicted more accurately when the spiking of neighbouring neurons is taken into account. Second, correlations provide additional sensory information: optimal, model-based decoding that exploits the response correlation structure extracts 20% more information about the visual scene than decoding under the assumption of independence, and preserves 40% more visual information than optimal linear decoding. This model-based approach reveals the role of correlated activity in the retinal coding of visual stimuli, and provides a general framework for understanding the importance of correlated activity in populations of neurons.},

@article{somers1995a,
	Abstract = {It is well known that visual cortical neurons respond vigorously to a limited range of stimulus orientations, while their primary afferent inputs, neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), respond well to all orientations. Mechanisms based on intracortical inhibition and/or converging thalamocortical afferents have previously been suggested to underlie the generation of cortical orientation selectivity; however, these models conflict with experimental data. Here, a 1:4 scale model of a 1700 microns by 200 microms region of layer IV of cat primary visual cortex (area 17) is presented to demonstrate that local intracortical excitation may provide the dominant source of orientation-selective input. In agreement with experiment, model cortical cells exhibit sharp orientation selectivity despite receiving strong iso-orientation inhibition, weak cross-orientation inhibition, no shunting inhibition, and weakly tuned thalamocortical excitation. Sharp tuning is provided by recurrent cortical excitation. As this tuning signal arises from the same pool of neurons that it excites, orientation selectivity in the model is shown to be an emergent property of the cortical feedback circuitry. In the model, as in experiment, sharpness of orientation tuning is independent of stimulus contrast and persists with silencing of ON-type subfields. The model also provides a unified account of intracellular and extracellular inhibitory blockade experiments that had previously appeared to conflict over the role of inhibition. It is suggested that intracortical inhibition acts nonspecifically and indirectly to maintain the selectivity of individual neurons by balancing strong intracortical excitation at the columnar level.},

	Abstract = {We explore the extent to which neocortical circuits generalize, i.e., to what extent can neocortical neurons and the circuits they form be considered as canonical? We find that, as has long been suspected by cortical neuroanatomists, the same basic laminar and tangential organization of the excitatory neurons of the neocortex is evident wherever it has been sought. Similarly, the inhibitory neurons show characteristic morphology and patterns of connections throughout the neocortex. We offer a simple model of cortical processing that is consistent with the major features of cortical circuits: The superficial layer neurons within local patches of cortex, and within areas, cooperate to explore all possible interpretations of different cortical input and cooperatively select an interpretation consistent with their various cortical and subcortical inputs.},

they favor a homogenous functional structure of cortex. They claim that a canonical circuit exists in the brain. However there are both similarities and differences across animals or even within a given brain. Their position would be that these are contingent upon the many different input output mappings of different brain areas. E.g. if a cat and human brain area X have similar strcutures OR if a M1 and V1 have different structures than this is should be due to the fact that these areas are characterized by different input-output relationships.

HORSE RADISH is a retragrade tracer... It allowed observation of laminar cortical structure.

" rules by which the afferents and efferents organize seem to be universal for all neocortical areas "

LAYER 1: 

distal tufts of pyramidal apical dendrites + few  GABAergic neurons + many axon terminations: major target of FEEDBACK connections.

APICAL VS BASAL DENDRITES

Basal dendrites forms 90% of the dendritic material radiating from a cell body.

GILBERT WIESEL MODEL

Thalamus ==> 4==> 2/3 ==> 5 ==> 6 ==> 4

we need to update this basic model by incorporating the following connections:

5A ==> superficial layers
6 ===> 3
6 ===> 6



SPINY NEURONS VS SMOOTH NEURONS
Interlaminar connections are mainly done by spiny neurons (95% of the striatal neurons).
They form asymmetrical synapses. 84 % of synapses in cat visual cortex are asymetrical.

Smooth neurons on the other hand are local neurons. They do not projects elsewhere, they arborize locally.

"The spiny neurons as a class provide most of the inter-laminar connections within a cortical area, whereas the axons of smooth neurons principally arborize locally 
within their layer of origin. Overall, the spiny cells provide the basic framework of long-distance excitation in both the vertical and lateral dimensions, which is then moulded by local inhibitory neurons."

Spiny Neurons ==> Excitatory
Smooth Neurons ==>Inhibitory.

LAYER 6
There are two type of layer 6 pyramidal neurons: one type is responsible of the connection 6==>4

"Matching these stratified patterns of thalamic afferent input to the middle layers are the stratified arbors of the axons of subtypes of the layer 6 pyramidal cells, most of which form axonal arborizations into the middle layers."
6==>Thalamus

Second type is responsible of feedback to thalamus.


----General Conclusion
"One desirable consequence of the increased stratification or sublamination is that it allows a higher selectivity in both the inputs that a particular neuron receives and ipso facto, a greater diversity of what is passed on to other brain regions" "If more precision is required for functional streaming, or if the outputs need to be diversified, then Nature's solution has not been to build entirely different circuits, but rather to focus axonal and dendritic arbors into a sublamina and duplicate or triplicate the same basic pattern of interlaminar excitatory connections."
--------------------------------------------------

Layer 5 pyramidal and layer 4 spinny cells can both be activated by Y-type thalamic afferents. Even though many of the synapses are expected to be done with layer 4 neurons, the activation amplitudes of the layer 5 neurons following thalamic stimulation are comparable to layer 4 spiny stellate neurons.

Question: What is the difference of spiny stellate and pyramidal?


LATERAL CONNECTION
It is only in the layer 3 that the intra layer connections are important, in all other layers bulk of the connectivity is about interlaminar projections.




3==>5
"The interlaminar projection from 
upper layer 3 pyramidal cells is to lower layer 5, whereas the pyramidal cells in the lower part of layer 3 arborize in the upper tier of layer 5"

So the main idea is that if projection to 4 from 6 obeys the functional segregation patterns of the thalamic afference than it could be that the 3 to 5 connections which also exhibit segregation, might indeed be governed by functional concerns.

	Abstract = {Recent neuroimaging studies have identified a set of brain regions that are metabolically active during wakeful rest and consistently deactivate in a variety the performance of demanding tasks. This "default network" has been functionally linked to the stream of thoughts occurring automatically in the absence of goal-directed activity and which constitutes an aspect of mental behavior specifically addressed by many meditative practices. Zen meditation, in particular, is traditionally associated with a mental state of full awareness but reduced conceptual content, to be attained via a disciplined regulation of attention and bodily posture. Using fMRI and a simplified meditative condition interspersed with a lexical decision task, we investigated the neural correlates of conceptual processing during meditation in regular Zen practitioners and matched control subjects. While behavioral performance did not differ between groups, Zen practitioners displayed a reduced duration of the neural response linked to conceptual processing in regions of the default network, suggesting that meditative training may foster the ability to control the automatic cascade of semantic associations triggered by a stimulus and, by extension, to voluntarily regulate the flow of spontaneous mentation.},

	Abstract = {The nervous system of the leech is a particularly suitable model to investigate neural coding of sensorimotor responses because it allows both observation of behavior and the simultaneous measurement of a large fraction of its underlying neuronal activity. In this study, we used a combination of multielectrode recordings, videomicroscopy, and computation of the optical flow to investigate the reproducibility of the motor response caused by local mechanical stimulation of the leech skin. We analyzed variability at different levels of processing: mechanosensory neurons, motoneurons, muscle activation, and behavior. Spike trains in mechanosensory neurons were very reproducible, unlike those in motoneurons. The motor response, however, was reproducible because of two distinct biophysical mechanisms. First, leech muscles contract slowly and therefore are poorly sensitive to the jitter of motoneuron spikes. Second, the motor response results from the coactivation of a population of motoneurons firing in a statistically independent way, which reduces the variability of the population firing. These data show that reproducible spike trains are not required to sustain reproducible behaviors and illustrate how the nervous system can cope with unreliable components to produce reliable action.},

Although responses to human sweat suggest a similar mechanism in humans, no particular component of human sweat capable of altering endocrine balance in conspecifics has yet been isolated and identified. Here, we measured salivary levels of the hormone cortisol in women after smelling pure androstadienone (4,16-androstadien-3-one), a molecule present in the sweat of men that has been suggested as a chemosignal in humans. We found that merely smelling androstadienone maintained significantly higher levels of the hormone cortisol in women. These results suggest that, like rodents, humans can influence the hormonal balance of conspecifics through chemosignals. Critically, this study identified a single component of sweat, androstadienone, as capable of exerting such influence. This result points to a potential role for synthetic human chemosignals in clinical applications.},

	Abstract = {When a target appears unpredictably in the same rather than a different location relative to a preceding onset cue, reaction times (RTs) of participants tasked with responding to the target are slowed. This pattern of results, referred to as inhibition of return (IOR), is believed to reflect the operation of a mechanism that prevents perseverative search of nontarget locations. On the grounds that an evolved mechanism might be sensitive to social stimuli, Taylor and Therrien (2005) examined IOR for localization responses under conditions in which cues and targets could be intact face configurations or nonface configurations; contrary to their predictions, there was no influence of cue or target configuration on the magnitude of IOR, indicating that the mere occurrence of task-irrelevant face and nonface stimuli does not alter IOR. In the present study, we further examined this issue in a task that required a face/nonface target discrimination. When target configuration was thereby made task relevant, we found that IOR differed for face and nonface targets in terms of magnitude (when a single cue-target stimulus onset asynchrony was employed) and time course. We suggest that the RT delay associated with IOR may enable additional processing time and/or response selection when a task-relevant face is presented at the cued location.},

	Abstract = {The responses of neurons in the visual cortex to stimuli presented within their receptive fields can be markedly modulated by stimuli presented in surrounding regions that do not themselves evoke responses. This modulation depends on the relative orientation and direction of motion of the centre and surround stimuli, and it has been suggested that local cortical circuits linking cells with similar stimulus selectivities underlie these phenomena. However, the functional relevance and nature of these integrative processes remain unclear. Here we investigate how such integration depends on the relative activity levels of neurons at different points across the cortex by varying the relative contrast of stimuli over the receptive field and surrounding regions. We show that simply altering the balance of the excitation driving centre and surround regions can dramatically change the sign and stimulus selectivity of these contextual effects. Thus, the way that single neurons integrate information across the visual field depends not only on the precise form of stimuli at different locations, but also crucially on their relative contrasts. We suggest that these effects reflect a complex gain-control mechanism that regulates cortical neuron responsiveness, which permits dynamic modification of response properties of cortical neurons.},

The outcome of radioiodine therapy depends mainly on the absorbed energy dose in the diseased thyroid tissue. The administered activity and the resulting target dose in the thyroid depend on both the biokinetics of radioiodine and the actual therapeutic effect of radioiodine in the thyroid. Thyrostatic drugs have a major influence on the kinetics of radioiodine in the thyroid and may additionally have a radioprotective effect. Pre-treatment with thyrostatic medication lowers the effective half-life and uptake of radioiodine. This can reduce the target dose in the thyroid and have a negative influence on the outcome of the therapy. Discontinuation of medication shortly before radioiodine administration can increase the absorbed energy dose in the thyroid without increasing the whole-body exposure to radiation as much as would a higher or second radioiodine administration. Furthermore, administration of non-radioactive iodine-127 2-3 days after radioiodine administration can also increase the effective half-life of radioiodine in the thyroid. Thus, improving the biokinetics of radioiodine will allow lower activities to be administered with lower effective doses to the rest of the body, while achieving an equally effective target dose in the thyroid.},

	Abstract = {System identification is a growing approach to sensory neurophysiology that facilitates the development of quantitative functional models of sensory processing. This approach provides a clear set of guidelines for combining experimental data with other knowledge about sensory function to obtain a description that optimally predicts the way that neurons process sensory information. This prediction paradigm provides an objective method for evaluating and comparing computational models. In this chapter we review many of the system identification algorithms that have been used in sensory neurophysiology, and we show how they can be viewed as variants of a single statistical inference problem. We then review many of the practical issues that arise when applying these methods to neurophysiological experiments: stimulus selection, behavioral control, model visualization, and validation. Finally we discuss several problems to which system identification has been applied recently, including one important long-term goal of sensory neuroscience: developing models of sensory systems that accurately predict neuronal responses under completely natural conditions.},

@article{thomson2000a,
	Abstract = {Fourier-phase information is important in determining the appearance of natural scenes, but the structure of natural-image phase spectra is highly complex and difficult to relate directly to human perceptual processes. This problem is addressed by extending previous investigations of human visual sensitivity to the randomisation and quantisation of Fourier phase in natural images. The salience of the image changes induced by these physical processes is shown to depend critically on the nature of the original phase spectrum of each image, and the processes of randomisation and quantisation are shown to be perceptually equivalent provided that they shift image phase components by the same average amount. These results are explained by assuming that the visual system is sensitive to those phase-domain image changes which also alter certain global higher-order image statistics. This assumption may be used to place constraints on the likely nature of cortical processing: mechanisms which correlate the outputs of a bank of relative-phase-sensitive units are found to be consistent with the patterns of sensitivity reported here.},

	Abstract = {I have noticed a striking effect that vision can have on movement: when a person makes circular motions with both hands, clockwise with the left hand, counterclockwise with the right hand, while watching the reflection of one hand in a parasagitally placed mirror, if one arm makes a vertical excursion, the other arm tends to make the same vertical excursion, but not typically if the excursing arm is viewed in plain vision. This observation may help in understand- ing how visual feedback via a mirror may be beneficial for rehabilitation of some patients with movement deficits secondary to certain neurologic conditions, and illustrates that the traditional division of neural processes into sensory input and motor output is somewhat arbitrary.},

	Abstract = {Local field potentials (LFPs) reflect subthreshold integrative processes that complement spike train measures. However, little is yet known about the differences between how LFPs and spikes encode rich naturalistic sensory stimuli. We addressed this question by recording LFPs and spikes from the primary visual cortex of anesthetized macaques while presenting a color movie. We then determined how the power of LFPs and spikes at different frequencies represents the visual features in the movie. We found that the most informative LFP frequency ranges were 1-8 and 60-100 Hz. LFPs in the range of 12-40 Hz carried little information about the stimulus, and may primarily reflect neuromodulatory inputs. Spike power was informative only at frequencies <12 Hz. We further quantified "signal correlations" (correlations in the trial-averaged power response to different stimuli) and "noise correlations" (trial-by-trial correlations in the fluctuations around the average) of LFPs and spikes recorded from the same electrode. We found positive signal correlation between high-gamma LFPs (60-100 Hz) and spikes, as well as strong positive signal correlation within high-gamma LFPs, suggesting that high-gamma LFPs and spikes are generated within the same network. LFPs <24 Hz shared strong positive noise correlations, indicating that they are influenced by a common source, such as a diffuse neuromodulatory input. LFPs <40 Hz showed very little signal and noise correlations with LFPs >40 Hz and with spikes, suggesting that low-frequency LFPs reflect neural processes that in natural conditions are fully decoupled from those giving rise to spikes and to high-gamma LFPs.},

@article{calegaro2000a,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Studies have been performed in order to assess a treatment with 131I able to induce a consistent improvement in Graves' hyperthyroidism. METHODS: Experimental design: For this purpose, four different protocols based on four different doses of radioiodine have been tested in Graves' disease patients. Patients never submitted previously to antithyroid drug treatment were given 1 mCi/10 gm of the estimated thyroid weight (group I; n = 50). Group II (n = 48) included patients not previously treated with antithyroid drugs and who were given doses of iodine based on a formula taking into account the rate of thyroid iodine uptake, i.e. 131I dose = microCi/gm of the estimated thyroid weight x 100/24 hrs 131I uptake (%). Patients previously submitted to antithyroid drug therapy were treated with radioiodine whose dose was calculated according to the formula reported above, but the dose was increased in order to overcome the possible resistance of this kind of patients to the effect of 131I. One group (group III; n = 24) received the calculated dose plus 1 microCi/gm of the estimated thyroid weight. Finally, group IV (n = 27) received the calculated dose plus 0.25 microCi/gm of the estimated thyroid weight. RESULTS: The analysis of the patients one year later demonstrated that groups I and II presented the higher percent of euthyroid patients (60% and 58%, respectively) followed by group IV (37%) and group III (29.2%). The percent of patients still exhibiting hyperthyroidism was 28% in group I, 26% in group IV, 12.5% in group III and 8.3% in group II. The highest number of hypothyroid patients was present in group III (58.3%) followed by group IV (37%), group II (33.3%) and group I (12%). CONCLUSIONS: The data here presented suggest that protocols I and II based on relatively low doses of radioiodine are rather effective in reducing Graves' hyperthyroidism in patients not submitted previously to antithyroid drug therapy. The most satisfactory therapy seems that utilized in protocol II, that in front of a fair amount of euthyroid patients (58.3%) presents a very low number of subjects still hyperthyroid (8.3%). However, the number of patients who became hypothyroid (33.3%) as a consequence of the therapy was too high. Hopefully, a better design of the protocol will reduce this figure. The high incidence of hyperthyroidism observed in groups III and IV submitted to a therapy with 131I doses consistently higher than those utilized in groups I and II seems to confirm the hypothesis that hyperthyroid subjects submitted to a therapy with antithyroid drugs become rather resistant to a radioiodine treatment.},

@article{dean1983a,
	Abstract = {The behaviour of neurones in cat striate cortex was examined in response to moving sinusoidal gratings and flashed bright and dark lines. The responses were summarized by three indices: discreteness was a measure of the degree of separation of inhibitory and excitatory regions in the receptive field; spatial summation ratio showed the degree of spatial summation within each region; relative modulation was a measure of the degree of modulation in the response to a moving grating. Some neurones had receptive fields with completely discrete excitatory and inhibitory regions; others responded equally to stimulus onset and offset throughout their receptive fields; however, some had overlapping excitatory and inhibitory regions. The degree of overlap varied continuously from complete separation to complete overlap. For neurones with discrete receptive fields, the widths of the regions were compared with the width of the bars in a grating of optimum spatial frequency to assess the degree of spatial summation within the regions. Most neurones with discrete receptive fields showed roughly predictable spatial summation, in that the two width measures agreed; but about 10% of them had receptive field regions that were too large by a factor of over two. The neurones which showed incomplete spatial summation also had considerable overlap of their excitatory and inhibitory regions. The waveforms of the responses to moving gratings of optimal spatial frequency were examined. The degree of modulation in the response was continuously distributed between low values typical of complex cells and high values typical of simple cells; the distribution was not bimodal. The degree of response modulation was closely correlated with the degree to which the excitatory and inhibitory regions in the receptive field were discrete. Both the degree of spatial summation and the degree of response modulation have been previously proposed as means for distinguishing simple and complex cells. In the present study, the continuity of the distributions of both indices ensured that neither index alone could be used to class all neurones unequivocally. However, a criterion based on two indices did allow classification. Simple and complex cells showed distinctive behaviour. However, complex cells with distinguishable excitatory and inhibitory regions in their receptive fields were not distinctly different from other complex cells.},

	Abstract = {Visual experience before eye-opening is not usually thought to have any developmental significance. Here we show that naturalistic visual stimuli presented through unopened eyelids robustly activate neurons in the ferret dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus. Further, dark-rearing prior to natural eye-opening has striking effects upon geniculate physiology. Receptive field maps after dark-rearing show increased convergence of On- and Off-center responses, and neurons frequently respond to both bright and dark phases of drifting gratings. There is also increased selectivity for the orientation of the gratings. These abnormalities of On-Off segregation can be explained by the finding that the responses of immature On and Off cells to naturalistic stimuli are strongly anticorrelated.},

	Abstract = {Integrating information across the senses can enhance our ability to detect and classify stimuli in the environment. For example, auditory speech perception is substantially improved when the speaker's face is visible. In an fMRI study designed to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying these crossmodal behavioural gains, bimodal (audio-visual) speech was contrasted against both unimodal (auditory and visual) components. Significant response enhancements in auditory (BA 41/42) and visual (V5) cortices were detected during bimodal stimulation. This effect was found to be specific to semantically congruent crossmodal inputs. These data suggest that the perceptual improvements effected by synthesizing matched multisensory inputs are realised by reciprocal amplification of the signal intensity in participating unimodal cortices.},

@article{helbig2008a,
	Abstract = {Some object properties (e.g., size, shape, and depth information) are perceived through multiple sensory modalities. Such redundant sensory information is integrated into a unified percept. The integrated estimate is a weighted average of the sensory estimates, where higher weight is attributed to the more reliable sensory signal. Here we examine whether modality-specific attention can affect multisensory integration. Selectively reducing attention in one sensory channel can reduce the relative reliability of the estimate derived from this channel and might thus alter the weighting of the sensory estimates. In the present study, observers performed unimodal (visual and haptic) and bimodal (visual-haptic) size discrimination tasks. They either performed the primary task alone or they performed a secondary task simultaneously (dual task). The secondary task consisted of a same/different judgment of rapidly presented visual letter sequences, and so might be expected to withdraw attention predominantly from the visual rather than the haptic channel. Comparing size discrimination performance in single- and dual-task conditions, we found that vision-based estimates were more affected by the secondary task than the haptics-based estimates, indicating that indeed attention to vision was more reduced than attention to haptics. This attentional manipulation, however, did not affect the cue weighting in the bimodal task. Bimodal discrimination performance was better than unimodal performance in both single- and dual-task conditions, indicating that observers still integrate visual and haptic size information in the dual-task condition, when attention is withdrawn from vision. These findings indicate that visual-haptic cue weighting is independent of modality-specific attention.},

	Abstract = {Our visual system preferentially groups contour segments that not only have the same orientation but are colinear as well. Long-range horizontal connections are thought to play an important role in context-dependent modifications of neuronal responses. Since the topology of these connections shows a close relation to the perceptual grouping criterion of colinearity, we tested whether the statistical properties of real world images are biased towards colinear contours. By wavelet analysis we detected contours in images of natural environments and calculated their spatial correlations. In urban as well as in natural environments, the correlations between colinear contour segments were larger than the correlations for parallel contour segments. These observations indicate that colinear contour segments dominate real world images and thus might bias the functional and structural development of our visual system.},

	Abstract = {To determine the direction of a sound source in space, animals must process a variety of auditory spatial cues, including interaural level and time differences, as well as changes in the sound spectrum caused by the direction-dependent filtering of sound by the outer ear. Behavioural deficits observed when primary auditory cortex (A1) is damaged have led to the widespread view that A1 may have an essential role in this complex computational task. Here we show, however, that the spatial selectivity exhibited by the large majority of A1 neurons is well predicted by a simple linear model, which assumes that neurons additively integrate sound levels in each frequency band and ear. The success of this linear model is surprising, given that computing sound source direction is a necessarily nonlinear operation. However, because linear operations preserve information, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that A1 may also form a gateway to higher, more specialized cortical areas.},

	Abstract = {In natural vision, shifts in spatial attention are associated with shifts of gaze. Computational models of such attention typically use the concept of a : Normalized maps of center---surround differences are computed for individual stimulus features and added linearly to obtain the saliency map. Although the predictions of such models correlate with fixated locations better than chance, their mechanistic assumptions are less well investigated. Here, we tested one key assumption: Do the effects of different features add linearly or according to a max-type of interaction? We measured the eye position of observers viewing natural stimuli whose luminance contrast and/or color contrast (saturation) increased gradually toward one side. We found that these biased fixations toward regions of high contrasts. When two contrast gradients (color and luminance) were superimposed, linear summation of their individual effects predicted their combined effect. This demonstrated that the interaction of color and luminance contrast with respect to human overt attention is---irrespective of the precise model---consistent with the assumption of linearity, but not with a max-type interaction of these features.},

@article{jay1984a,
	Abstract = {The process by which sensory signals are transformed into commands for the control of movement is poorly understood. A potential site for such a transformation is the superior colliculus (SC), which receives auditory, visual and somatosensory inputs and contains neurones that discharge before saccadic eye movements. Along the primary sensory pathways, signals coding the spatial location of auditory, visual and somatosensory targets are based on distinctly different coordinate systems, and it is not known whether each type of sensory input uses a separate motor pathway or if they are converted into a common coordinate system in order to share a single pre-motor circuit. Sensory neurones in the SC have spatially restricted receptive fields (RFs) and are organized into maps across the collicular surface. Acute experiments have shown a rough correspondence between the spatial positions of RFs of neurones encountered along a single dorsal-ventral penetration of the colliculus, regardless of the modality of the effective stimulus, suggesting that auditory, visual and somatosensory maps might be in register. However, in these conditions the head-centred auditory system and the retinotopic visual system are aligned because the eyes are in the primary orbital position. Moreover, other data have suggested that the primate SC is organized in motor, not sensory, coordinates, although in the cat, eye position was found to have no effect on auditory receptive fields. We therefore sought here to determine what happens to the registration of the auditory and visual maps in the alert, behaving animal. Monkeys, with heads fixed, were trained to make delayed saccadic eye movements to auditory or visual targets from one of three initial fixation points while the activity of single neurones was recorded extracellularly. We found that the auditory receptive fields shifted with changes in eye position, allowing the auditory and visual maps to remain in register.},

	Abstract = {Simple cells in the visual cortex respond to the precise position of oriented contours (Hubel and Wiesel, 1962). This sensitivity reflects the structure of the simple receptive field, which exhibits two sorts of antagonism between on and off inputs. First, simple receptive fields are divided into adjacent on and off subregions; second, within each subregion, stimuli of the reverse contrast evoke responses of the opposite sign: push-pull (Hubel and Wiesel, 1962; Palmer and Davis, 1981; Jones and Palmer, 1987; Ferster, 1988). We have made whole-cell patch recordings from cat area 17 during visual stimulation to examine the generation and integration of excitation (push) and suppression (pull) in the simple receptive field. The temporal structure of the push reflected the pattern of thalamic inputs, as judged by comparing the intracellular cortical responses to extracellular recordings made in the lateral geniculate nucleus. Two mechanisms have been advanced to account for the pull-withdrawal of thalamic drive and active, intracortical inhibition (Hubel and Wiesel, 1962; Heggelund, 1968; Ferster, 1988). Our results suggest that intracortical inhibition is the dominant, and perhaps sole, mechanism of suppression. The inhibitory influences operated within a wide dynamic range. When inhibition was strong, the membrane conductance could be doubled or tripled. Furthermore, if a stimulus confined to one subregion was enlarged so that it extended into the next, the sign of response often changed from depolarizing to hyperpolarizing. In other instances, the inhibition modulated neuronal output subtly, by elevating spike threshold or altering firing rate at a given membrane voltage.},

@article{mante2005a,
	Abstract = {A recent optical imaging study of primary visual cortex (V1) by Basole, White, and Fitzpatrick demonstrated that maps of preferred orientation depend on the choice of stimuli used to measure them. These authors measured population responses expressed as a function of the optimal orientation of long drifting bars. They then varied bar length, direction, and speed and found that stimuli of a same orientation can elicit different population responses and stimuli with different orientation can elicit similar population responses. We asked whether these results can be explained from known properties of V1 receptive fields. We implemented an "energy model" where a receptive field integrates stimulus energy over a region of three-dimensional frequency space. The population of receptive fields defines a volume of visibility, which covers all orientations and a plausible range of spatial and temporal frequencies. This energy model correctly predicts the population response to bars of different length, direction, and speed and explains the observations made with optical imaging. The model also readily explains a related phenomenon, the appearance of motion streaks for fast-moving dots. We conclude that the energy model can be applied to activation maps of V1 and predicts phenomena that may otherwise appear to be surprising. These results indicate that maps obtained with optical imaging reflect the layout of neurons selective for stimulus energy, not for isolated stimulus features such as orientation, direction, and speed.},

	Abstract = {Human sound localization relies on implicit head-centered acoustic cues. However, to create a stable and accurate representation of sounds despite intervening head movements, the acoustic input should be continuously combined with feedback signals about changes in head orientation. Alternatively, the auditory target coordinates could be updated in advance by using either the preprogrammed gaze-motor command or the sensory target coordinates to which the intervening gaze shift is made ("predictive remapping"). So far, previous experiments cannot dissociate these alternatives. Here, we study whether the auditory system compensates for ongoing saccadic eye and head movements in two dimensions that occur during target presentation. In this case, the system has to deal with dynamic changes of the acoustic cues as well as with rapid changes in relative eye and head orientation that cannot be preprogrammed by the audiomotor system. We performed visual-auditory double-step experiments in two dimensions in which a brief sound burst was presented while subjects made a saccadic eye-head gaze shift toward a previously flashed visual target. Our results show that localization responses under these dynamic conditions remain accurate. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that the intervening eye and head movements are fully accounted for. Moreover, elevation response components were more accurate for longer-duration sounds (50 msec) than for extremely brief sounds (3 msec), for all localization conditions. Taken together, these results cannot be explained by a predictive remapping scheme. Rather, we conclude that the human auditory system adequately processes dynamically varying acoustic cues that result from self-initiated rapid head movements to construct a stable representation of the target in world coordinates. This signal is subsequently used to program accurate eye and head localization responses.},

	Abstract = {The human brain analyzes a visual object first by basic feature detectors. On the objects way to a conscious percept, these features are integrated in subsequent stages of the visual hierarchy. The time course of this feature integration is largely unknown. To shed light on the temporal dynamics of feature integration, we applied transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to a feature fusion paradigm. In feature fusion, two stimuli which differ in one feature are presented in rapid succession such that they are not perceived individually but as one single stimulus only. The fused percept is an integration of the features of both stimuli. Here, we show that TMS can modulate this integration for a surprisingly long period of time, even though the individual stimuli themselves are not consciously perceived. Hence, our results reveal a long-lasting integration process of unconscious feature traces.},

@article{bonhoeffer1993a,
	Abstract = {In this study we used optical imaging based on activity-dependent intrinsic signals to determine the distribution of cells responding to gratings of various orientations moving in different directions in area 18 of cat visual cortex. To test directional-selective clustering of neurons, we compared cortical activity maps obtained by stimulation with two gratings of identical orientation but moving in opposite directions. We found those maps to be almost identical, suggesting that neurons are not notably clustered into directionality columns. We also compared activity maps obtained with gratings of different orientations. Each of the orientation maps was similar to the 2-deoxyglucose maps previously reported. Having compiled the information obtained from the different orientations into one "orientation preference map," we found, in contrast to earlier reports, that iso-orientation domains are not elongated parallel bands but are small patches organized in "pinwheels" around points that we refer to as "orientation centers." We furthermore show that the only locations at which orientation preference changes rapidly are these orientation centers and not lines or loops. In addition, this report clarifies that our observations on the functional architecture of cat area 18, although at first sight at variance with earlier observations, are actually fully consistent with them. We therefore propose that in cat visual cortex pinwheel-like patterns of orientation preference form an irregular mosaic of modular units with an average density of 1.2 pinwheels per square millimeter.},

	Abstract = {A monkey was trained to respond on the basis of the serial position of a test stimulus in a sequence. First, three stimuli were presented successively on a circle. Then one of them (except the last) changed color (test stimulus) and served as the go signal: The monkey was required to produce a motor response in the direction of the stimulus that followed the test stimulus. When the test stimulus was the second in the sequence, there was a change in motor cortical activity from a pattern reflecting the direction of this stimulus to the pattern associated with the direction of the motor response. This change was abrupt, occurred 100 to 150 milliseconds after the go signal, and was evident both in the activity of single cells and in the time-varying neuronal population vector. These findings identify the neural correlates of a switching process that is different from a mental rotation described previously.},

	Abstract = {The deployment of human gaze has been almost exclusively studied independent of any specific ongoing task and limited to two-dimensional picture viewing. This contrasts with its use in everyday life, which mostly consists of purposeful tasks where gaze is crucially involved. To better understand deployment of gaze under such circumstances, we devised a series of experiments, in which subjects navigated along a walkway in a virtual environment and executed combinations of approach and avoidance tasks. The position of the body and the gaze were monitored during the execution of the task combinations and dependence of gaze on the ongoing tasks as well as the visual features of the scene was analyzed. Gaze distributions were compared to a random gaze allocation strategy as well as a specific "saliency model." Gaze distributions showed high similarity across subjects. Moreover, the precise fixation locations on the objects depended on the ongoing task to the point that the specific tasks could be predicted from the subject's fixation data. By contrast, gaze allocation according to a random or a saliency model did not predict the executed fixations or the observed dependence of fixation locations on the specific task.},

@article{tatler2007b,
	Abstract = {Observers show a marked tendency to fixate the center of the screen when viewing scenes on computer monitors. This is often assumed to arise because image features tend to be biased toward the center of natural images and fixations are correlated with image features. A common alternative explanation is that experiments typically use a central pre-trial fixation marker, and observers tend to make small amplitude saccades. In the present study, the central bias was explored by dividing images post hoc according to biases in their image feature distributions. Central biases could not be explained by motor biases for making small saccades and were found irrespective of the distribution of image features. When the scene appeared, the initial response was to orient to the center of the screen. Following this, fixation distributions did not vary with image feature distributions when freely viewing scenes. When searching the scenes, fixation distributions shifted slightly toward the distribution of features in the image, primarily during the first few fixations after the initial orienting response. The endurance of the central fixation bias irrespective of the distribution of image features, or the observer's task, implies one of three possible explanations: First, the center of the screen may be an optimal location for early information processing of the scene. Second, it may simply be that the center of the screen is a convenient location from which to start oculomotor exploration of the scene. Third, it may be that the central bias reflects a tendency to re-center the eye in its orbit.},

While intuition may point toward high-level object recognition and cognitive processes, here we investigate the contributions of a much simpler process, low-level visual saliency. We used the LabelMe database (24,863 photographs with 74,454 manually outlined objects) to evaluate how often interesting objects were among the few most salient locations predicted by a computational model of bottom-up attention. In 43% of all images the model's predicted most salient location falls within a labeled region (chance 21%). Furthermore, in 76% of the images (chance 43%), one or more of the top three salient locations fell on an outlined object, with performance leveling off after six predicted locations. The bottom-up attention model has neither notion of object nor notion of semantic relevance. Hence, our results indicate that selecting interesting objects in a scene is largely constrained by low-level visual properties rather than solely determined by higher cognitive processes.},

	Abstract = {We explored the spatio-temporal dynamics of odor-evoked activity in the rat and mouse main olfactory bulb (MOB) using voltage-sensitive dye imaging (VSDI) with a new probe. The high temporal resolution of VSDI revealed odor-specific sequences of glomerular activation. Increasing odor concentrations reduced response latencies, increased response amplitudes, and recruited new glomerular units. However, the sequence of glomerular activation was maintained. Furthermore, we found distributed MOB activity locked to the nasal respiration cycle. The spatial distribution of its amplitude and phase was heterogeneous and changed by sensory input in an odor-specific manner. Our data show that in the mammalian olfactory bulb, odor identity and concentration are represented by spatio-temporal patterns, rather than spatial patterns alone.},

	Abstract = {Humans often redirect their gaze to the same objects within a scene, even without being consciously aware of it. Here, we investigated what type of visual information is accumulated across recurrent fixations on the same object. On each trial, subjects viewed an array comprised of several objects and were subsequently asked to report on various visual aspects of a randomly chosen target object from that array. Memory performance decreased as more fixations were directed to other objects, following the last fixation on the target object (i.e. post-target fixations). In contrast, performance was enhanced with increasing number of fixations on the target object. However, since the number of post-target fixations and the number of target fixations are usually anti-correlated, memory gain may simply reflect fewer post-target fixations, rather than true accumulation of information. To rule this out, we conducted a second experiment, in which the stimulus disappeared immediately after performing a predefined number of target fixations. Additional fixations on the target object resulted in improved memory performance even under these strict conditions. We conclude that, under the present conditions, various aspects of memory monotonically improve with repeated sampling of the same object.},

@article{takashima2005a,
	Abstract = {The intervibrissal fur-evoked activity in the rat somatosensory cortex was investigated using high-resolution optical imaging with a voltage-sensitive dye. The optical imaging revealed that the intervibrissal fur representation forms a U-shaped band around the borders of the posteromedial barrel subfield (PMBSF), and that this representation is characterized by a rostral-to-caudal somatotopic organization. When GABA(A)-mediated inhibition was partially suppressed by treatment with bicuculline, stimulation of the intervibrissal fur elicited spreading of an excitation wave in an area outside the PMBSF. The spreading wave propagated in both directions along the aforementioned U-shaped band of cortex, but barely invaded the center of the PMBSF. These imaging results suggest a distinct subdivision of cortex adjacent to, but outside, the PMBSF in the rat somatosensory cortex; this region receives input from intervibrissal fur, and seems to process its sensory information through well-developed local horizontal connections.},

	Abstract = {The role of intrinsic cortical connections in processing sensory input and in generating behavioral output is poorly understood. We have examined this issue in the context of the tuning of neuronal responses in cortex to the orientation of a visual stimulus. We analytically study a simple network model that incorporates both orientation-selective input from the lateral geniculate nucleus and orientation-specific cortical interactions. Depending on the model parameters, the network exhibits orientation selectivity that originates from within the cortex, by a symmetry-breaking mechanism. In this case, the width of the orientation tuning can be sharp even if the lateral geniculate nucleus inputs are only weakly anisotropic. By using our model, several experimental consequences of this cortical mechanism of orientation tuning are derived. The tuning width is relatively independent of the contrast and angular anisotropy of the visual stimulus. The transient population response to changing of the stimulus orientation exhibits a slow "virtual rotation." Neuronal cross-correlations exhibit long time tails, the sign of which depends on the preferred orientations of the cells and the stimulus orientation.},

	Abstract = {It is hypothesized that eye movements are used to coordinate elements of a mental model with elements of the visual field. In two experiments, eye movements were recorded while observers imagined or recalled objects that were not present in the visual display. In both cases, observers spontaneously looked at particular blank regions of space in a systematic fashion, to manipulate and organize spatial relationships between mental and/or retinal images. These results contribute to evidence that interpreting a linguistic description of a visual scene requires a spatial (mental model) representation, and they support claims regarding the allocation of position markers in visual space for the manipulation of visual attention. More broadly, our results point to a concrete embodiment of cognition, in that a construction of a mental image is almost "acted out" by the eye movements, and a mental search of internal memory is accompanied by an ocolumotor search of external space.},

@article{wang2003b,
	Abstract = {Limiting redundancy in the real-world sensory inputs is of obvious benefit for efficient neural coding, but little is known about how this may be accomplished by biophysical neural mechanisms. One possible cellular mechanism is through adaptation to relatively constant inputs. Recent investigations in primary visual (V1) cortical neurons have demonstrated that adaptation to prolonged changes in stimulus contrast is mediated in part through intrinsic ionic currents, a Ca2+-activated K+ current (IKCa) and especially a Na+-activated K+ current (IKNa). The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that the activation of adaptation ionic currents may provide a cellular mechanism for temporal decorrelation in V1. A conductance-based neuron model was simulated, which included an IKCa and an IKNa. We show that the model neuron reproduces the adaptive behavior of V1 neurons in response to high contrast inputs. When the stimulus is stochastic with 1/f 2 or 1/f-type temporal correlations, these autocorrelations are greatly reduced in the output spike train of the model neuron. The IKCa is effective at reducing positive temporal correlations at approximately 100-ms time scale, while a slower adaptation mediated by IKNa is effective in reducing temporal correlations over the range of 1-20 s. Intracellular injection of stochastic currents into layer 2/3 and 4 (pyramidal and stellate) neurons in ferret primary visual cortical slices revealed neuronal responses that exhibited temporal decorrelation in similarity with the model. Enhancing the slow afterhyperpolarization resulted in a strengthening of the decorrelation effect. These results demonstrate the intrinsic membrane properties of neocortical neurons provide a mechanism for decorrelation of sensory inputs.},

	Abstract = {The ventriloquist creates the illusion that his or her voice emerges from the visibly moving mouth of the puppet [1]. This well-known illusion exemplifies a basic principle of how auditory and visual information is integrated in the brain to form a unified multimodal percept. When auditory and visual stimuli occur simultaneously at different locations, the more spatially precise visual information dominates the perceived location of the multimodal event. Previous studies have examined neural interactions between spatially disparate auditory and visual stimuli [2-5], but none has found evidence for a visual influence on the auditory cortex that could be directly linked to the illusion of a shifted auditory percept. Here we utilized event-related brain potentials combined with event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging to demonstrate on a trial-by-trial basis that a precisely timed biasing of the left-right balance of auditory cortex activity by the discrepant visual input underlies the ventriloquist illusion. This cortical biasing may reflect a fundamental mechanism for integrating the auditory and visual components of environmental events, which ensures that the sounds are adaptively localized to the more reliable position provided by the visual input.},

	Abstract = {The perception of visual depth is determined by integration of spatial disparities of inputs from the two eyes. Single cells in visual cortex of monkeys are known to respond to specific binocular disparities; however, little is known about their functional organization. We now show, using intrinsic signal optical imaging and single-unit physiology, that, in the thick stripe compartments of the second visual area (V2), there is a clustered organization of Near cells and Far cells, and moreover, there are topographic maps for Near to Far disparities within V2. Our findings suggest that maps for visual disparity are calculated in V2, and demonstrate parallels in functional organization between the thin, pale, and thick stripes of V2.},

	Abstract = {To what extent do all brains work alike during natural conditions? We explored this question by letting five subjects freely view half an hour of a popular movie while undergoing functional brain imaging. Applying an unbiased analysis in which spatiotemporal activity patterns in one brain were used to "model" activity in another brain, we found a striking level of voxel-by-voxel synchronization between individuals, not only in primary and secondary visual and auditory areas but also in association cortices. The results reveal a surprising tendency of individual brains to "tick collectively" during natural vision. The intersubject synchronization consisted of a widespread cortical activation pattern correlated with emotionally arousing scenes and regionally selective components. The characteristics of these activations were revealed with the use of an open-ended "reverse-correlation" approach, which inverts the conventional analysis by letting the brain signals themselves "pick up" the optimal stimuli for each specialized cortical area.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Surgery for Graves' disease was largely replaced in the mid-1900s by radioiodine and antithyroid drugs, due to the belief that they were more safe and effective. Since then, thyroid surgery has improved with preoperative drug therapy and modern operative techniques. Recent clinical studies of thyroidectomy for Graves' disease may not reflect outcomes accurately because of small sample size, especially when estimating ideal thyroid remnant size. The purpose of this study was to combine modern clinical trials and use meta-analysis to determine the overall efficacy of both total (TT) and subtotal thyroidectomy (ST) for Graves' disease, compare thyroid function and complications rates of TT and ST, and determine ideal thyroid remnant size. METHODS: Meta-analysis was performed on published studies in which patients underwent either TT or ST for Graves' disease. Meta-analysis was performed by weighted least-squares linear regression. P < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: There were 35 studies comprising 7241 patients. Mean follow-up was 5.6 years. Overall, persistent or recurrent hyperthyroidism occurred in 7.2% of patients. TT was performed on 538 patients and hypothyroidism occurred in all cases. ST was performed in 6703 patients, 59.7% of whom achieved euthyroidism, 25. 6% became hypothyroid, and 7.9% had either persistent or recurrent hyperthyroidism. Permanent recurrent laryngeal nerve injury occurred in 0.9% of TT patients and 0.7% of ST patients (P = NS). Permanent hypoparathyroidism occurred in 1.6% of TT patients and 1.0% of ST patients (P = NS). There was an 8.9% decrease in hypothyroidism and 6.9% increase in euthyroidism for each gram of thyroid remnant (P < 0.0001 each). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, thyroidectomy successfully treated hyperthyroidism in 92% of patients with Graves' disease. There were no cases of hyperthyroidism following TT. ST achieved a euthyroid state in almost 60% of patients with an 8% rate of persistent or recurrent hyperthyroidism. There was no significant difference in complication rates between TT and ST.},

	Abstract = {Graves' disease (GD) is characterized by circulating TSH receptor antibodies (TRAb), and so-called hyperthyroid autoimmune thyroiditis (H-AIT) generally shows negative TRAb results with first-generation assays. However, a positive titer was observed in up to 13% of patients with euthyroid or hypothyroid autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT) by second-generation TRAb assays, and a larger increase is expected in hyperfunctioning forms. A thyroid 99mTc-pertechnetate uptake (TcTUs) cutoff of 2% previously was shown to accurately discriminate between GD and H-AIT. Here we evaluated the relationship between second-generation TRAb assays and TcTUs in 139 patients with untreated autoimmune hyperthyroidism. An increase in TRAb levels was found in 114 of 139 patients (82%). All patients with TcTUs >2% and 66% of those with lower values had positive TRAb measurements. When the cutoff was increased to 5.9 U/l, positive TRAb occurred in 92.6% of those having higher TcTUs and in 1.4% of those with lower TcTUs. TRAb levels significantly increased in patients with TcTUs higher than 2% as compared with those having lower values, while no differences occurred in patients with TcTUs ranging from 0 to 1%, from 1.1 to 1.5%, or from 1.6 to 2%. A significant relationship between TRAb and TcTUs (as well as fT3, fT4, and thyroid volume) was found. TcTUs, fT4, fT3, and thyroid volume significantly increased in patients with positive TRAb (cutoff 1.5 U/l) compared with those testing negative. Our data indicate that a large proportion of patients with hyperthyroidism and hypoechoic thyroid, including those previously diagnosed as having H-AIT, actually have circulating TRAb. TRAb levels predicate the degree of iodine uptake (as measured by TcTUs) and thyroid hyperfunction. The role of baseline TRAb measurement by second-generation assays to predict patients' outcome needs to be further evaluated and compared with TcTUs in prospective studies.},

@article{salvi2008a,
	Abstract = {Steroids have been used in the therapy of the moderate to severe forms of Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO) and other autoimmune diseases as they act only as general immunosuppressants. Previous work has shown that blocking the CD-20 receptor on B lymphocytes has significantly affected the clinical course of GO, by rapidly reducing inflammation and the degree of proptosis. We have studied nine patients with Graves' disease, of whom seven had active GO and two, with newly diagnosed hyperthyroidism, only mild lid signs. We also studied a group of 20 consecutive patients, treated with intravenous glucocorticoids (IVGC) according to a standard protocol. Patients treated with RTX (1000mg i.v. twice at two-week interval) and those treated with IVGC (500mg i.v. for 16 weeks) were studied monthly up to 12 months after the first drug infusion. By ophthalmological examination, GO was assessed by the clinical activity score (CAS) and by the NOSPECS score. Thyroid function and lymphocyte count were measured by standardized methods. RTX was well-tolerated and only minor side-effects were reported in 30% of patients during the first infusion. All patients attained peripheral B-cell depletion with the first RTX infusion. All but one patients showed both CD20+ cells and CD19+ cells depletion, while one had persistent 3-5% CD19+ cells in the periphery, mostly CD19+5+. Thyroid function was not affected by RTX therapy. Titers of antithyroglobulin (TgAb), antithyroperoxidase and anti-TSH receptor antibodies (TRAb) did not change significantly (P=NS) and did not correlate to CD20+ depletion (P=NS). CAS values decreased significantly (P<0.0001). Proptosis decreased significantly after RTX in both patients with active GO (ANOVA; P<0.0001) and in those with Graves' hyperthyroidism and lid signs (ANOVA; P<0.003). The degree of inflammation (NOSPECS class 2) decreased significantly in response to RTX (ANOVA; P<0.001). In patients treated with IVGC, mean CAS value decreased significantly less than in those treated with RTX (P<0.05). Adverse effects were more frequent after IVGC (45% of patients). Seventy-five percent of patients responded to IVGC and 10% showed relapse of active GO six to eight weeks after withdrawal. The results of this study on RTX in GO suggest that the drug is effective in modifying the disease course and that the improvement of the clinical activity of GO after RTX was more significant than after IVGC. We did not observe relapse of active GO, even after B-cell return in peripheral blood. This might be related to the persistence of a significant degree of B-cell depletion after RTX observed in the peripheral blood as late as two years of follow-up. RTX therapy was also effective in improving proptosis and soft tissue inflammation. The mechanism by which RTX affects GO is unknown. It may act as a true immunosuppressor by switching off reactions inducing the active phase of TAO, perhaps by influencing the cytokine production in the orbit or by inducing depletion of antigen presenting B-cells.},

	Abstract = {How do bottom-up and top-down guidance signals combine to guide search behavior? Observers searched for a target either with or without a preview (top-down manipulation) or a color singleton (bottom-up manipulation) among the display objects. With a preview, reaction times were faster and more initial eye movements were guided to the target; the singleton failed to attract initial saccades under these conditions. Only in the absence of a preview did subjects preferentially fixate the color singleton. We conclude that the search for realistic objects is guided primarily by top-down control. Implications for saliency map models of visual search are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Although the parietal cortex has been implicated in the neural processes underlying visual attention, the nature of its contribution is not well understood. We tracked attention in the monkey and correlated the activity of neurons in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) with the monkey's attentional performance. The ensemble activity in LIP across the entire visual field describes the spatial and temporal dynamics of a monkey's attention. Activity subtending a single location in the visual field describes the attentional priority at that area but does not predict that the monkey will actually attend to or make an eye movement to that location.},

	Abstract = {The origin of orientation selectivity in the responses of simple cells in cat visual cortex serves as a model problem for understanding cortical circuitry and computation. The feed-forward model posits that this selectivity arises simply from the arrangement of thalamic inputs to a simple cell. Much evidence, including a number of recent intracellular studies, supports a primary role of the thalamic inputs in determining simple cell response properties, including orientation tuning. This mechanism alone, however, cannot explain the invariance of orientation tuning to changes in stimulus contrast. Simple cells receive push-pull inhibition: ON inhibition in OFF subregions and vice versa. Addition of such inhibition to the feed-forward model can account for this contrast invariance, provided the inhibition is sufficiently strong. The predictions of "normalization" and "feedback" models are reviewed and compared with the predictions of this modified feed-forward model and with experimental results. The modified feed-forward and the feedback models ascribe fundamentally different functions to cortical processing.},

	Abstract = {Understanding the conditions under which the brain integrates the different sensory streams and the mechanisms supporting this phenomenon is now a question at the forefront of neuroscience. In this paper, we discuss the opportunities for investigating these multisensory processes using modern imaging techniques, the nature of the information obtainable from each method and their benefits and limitations. Despite considerable variability in terms of paradigm design and analysis, some consistent findings are beginning to emerge. The detection of brain activity in human neuroimaging studies that resembles multisensory integration responses at the cellular level in other species, suggests similar crossmodal binding mechanisms may be operational in the human brain. These mechanisms appear to be distributed across distinct neuronal networks that vary depending on the nature of the shared information between different sensory cues. For example, differing extents of correspondence in time, space or content seem to reliably bias the involvement of different integrative networks which code for these cues. A combination of data obtained from haemodynamic and electromagnetic methods, which offer high spatial or temporal resolution respectively, are providing converging evidence of multisensory interactions at both "early" and "late" stages of processing--suggesting a cascade of synergistic processes operating in parallel at different levels of the cortex.},

	Abstract = {The primary visual cortex, a relatively early station in the visual pathway, has long been considered mainly as a site of basic feature detection but evidence is emerging that is consistent with the existence of feedback influences from higher cortical areas. We show that in a delayed match-to-sample memory task, where the monkey needs to remember both the visual pattern and its location, there is significant modulation of neuronal activity in the primary visual cortex suggestive of a feedback signal. Responses to identical patterns are remarkably different depending upon their place in the memory task. These modulatory influences are significantly less when the same visual patterns are shown during a simple fixation task, where these stimuli can be ignored and not attended to. The results indicate that neural processing specific to attentional and mnemonic functions can involve even primary sensory areas.},

@article{einhauser2002a,
	Abstract = {Neurons in primary visual cortex are typically classified as either simple or complex. Whereas simple cells respond strongly to grating and bar stimuli displayed at a certain phase and visual field location, complex cell responses are insensitive to small translations of the stimulus within the receptive field [Hubel {\&} Wiesel (1962) J. Physiol. (Lond.), 160, 106-154; Kjaer et al. (1997) J. Neurophysiol., 78, 3187-3197]. This constancy in the response to variations of the stimuli is commonly called invariance. Hubel and Wiesel's classical model of the primary visual cortex proposes a connectivity scheme which successfully describes simple and complex cell response properties. However, the question as to how this connectivity arises during normal development is left open. Based on their work and inspired by recent physiological findings we suggest a network model capable of learning from natural stimuli and developing receptive field properties which match those of cortical simple and complex cells. Stimuli are drawn from videos obtained by a camera mounted to a cat's head, so they should approximate the natural input to the cat's visual system. The network uses a competitive scheme to learn simple and complex cell response properties. Employing delayed signals to learn connections between simple and complex cells enables the model to utilize temporal properties of the input. We show that the temporal structure of the input gives rise to the emergence and refinement of complex cell receptive fields, whereas removing temporal continuity prevents this processes. This model lends a physiologically based explanation of the development of complex cell invariance response properties.},

	Abstract = {Many biological and artificial neural networks require the parallel extraction of multiple features, and meet this requirement with distinct populations of neurons that are selective to one property of the stimulus while being non-selective to another property. In this way, several populations can resolve a set of features independently of each other, and thus achieve a parallel mode of processing. This raises the question how an initially homogeneous population of neurons segregates into groups with distinct and complementary response properties. Using a colour image sequence recorded from a camera mounted on the head of a freely behaving cat, we train a network of neurons to achieve optimally stable responses, that is, responses that change minimally over time. This objective leads to the development of colour-selective neurons. Adding a second objective, decorrelating activity within the network, a subpopulation of neurons develops with achromatic response properties. Colour selective neurons tend to be non-oriented while achromatic neurons are orientation-tuned. The proposed objective thus successfully leads to the segregation of neurons into complementary populations that are either selective for colour or orientation.},

	Abstract = {The effects of stimuli falling outside the 'classical receptive field' and their influence on the orientation selectivity of cells in the cat primary visual cortex are still matters of debate. Here we examine the variety of effects of such peripheral stimuli on responses to stimuli limited to the receptive field. We first determined the extent of the classical receptive field by increasing the diameter of a circular patch of drifting grating until the response saturated or reached a maximum, and by decreasing the diameter of a circular mask in the middle of an extended grating, centred on the receptive field, until the cell just began to respond. These two estimates always agreed closely. We then presented an optimum grating of medium-to-high contrast filling the classical receptive field while stimulating the surround with a drifting grating that had the same parameters as the central stimulus but was varied in orientation. For all but five neurons (of 37 tested), surround stimulation produced clear suppression over some range of orientations, while none showed explicit facilitation under these conditions. For 11 cells (34% of those showing suppression), the magnitude of suppression did not vary consistently with the orientation of the surround stimulus. In the majority of cells, suppression was weakest for a surround grating oriented orthogonal to the cell's optimum. Nine of these cells (28%) exhibited maximum inhibition at the optimum orientation for the receptive field itself, but for 12 cells (38%) there was apparent 'release' from inhibition for surround gratings at or near the cell's optimum orientation and direction, leaving inhibition either maximal at angles flanking the optimum (9 cells) or broadly distributed over the rest of the orientation range (3 cells). This implies the existence of a subliminal facilitatory mechanism, tightly tuned at or near the cell's optimum orientation, extending outside the classical receptive field. For just two cells of 13 tested the preferred orientation for a central grating was clearly shifted towards the orientation of a surrounding grating tilted away from the cell's optimum. The contrast gain for central stimulation at the optimal orientation was measured with and without a surround pattern. For nine of 25 cells tested, surround stimulation at the cell's optimum orientation facilitated the response to a central grating of low contrast (< or =0.1) but inhibited that to a higher-contrast central stimulus: the contrast-response gain is reduced but the threshold contrast is actually decreased by surround stimulation. Hence the receptive field is effectively larger for low-contrast than for high-contrast stimuli. Inhibition from the periphery is usually greatest at or around the cell's optimum, while suppression within the receptive field has been shown to be largely non-selective for orientation. Inhibition by orientations flanking the optimum could serve to sharpen orientation selectivity in the presence of contextual stimuli and to enhance orientational contrast; and it may play a part in orientation contrast illusions.},

All were inhibited by the surround when the central stimulus was of higher contrast, as used routinely in the initial assessment of surround effects. "},

	Abstract = {Our nervous system typically processes signals from multiple sensory modalities at any given moment and is therefore posed with two important problems: which of the signals are caused by a common event, and how to combine those signals. We investigated human perception in the presence of auditory, visual, and tactile stimulation in a numerosity judgment task. Observers were presented with stimuli in one, two, or three modalities simultaneously and were asked to report their percepts in each modality. The degree of congruency between the modalities varied across trials. For example, a single flash was paired in some trials with two beeps and two taps. Cross-modal illusions were observed in most conditions in which there was incongruence among the two or three stimuli, revealing robust interactions among the three modalities in all directions. The observers' bimodal and trimodal percepts were remarkably consistent with a Bayes-optimal strategy of combining the evidence in each modality with the prior probability of the events. These findings provide evidence that the combination of sensory information among three modalities follows optimal statistical inference for the entire spectrum of conditions.},

	Abstract = {We present a new technique for acquiring and analyzing intrinsic signal optical images of brain activity, using continuous stimulus presentation and data acquisition. The main idea is to present a temporally periodic stimulus and to analyze the component of the response at the stimulus frequency. Advantages of the new technique include the removal of heart, respiration, and vasomotor artifacts, a dramatic increase in spatial resolution, and a 30-fold or greater reduction in acquisition time. We also present a novel approach to localizing instantaneous neuronal responses using time-reversed stimuli that is widely applicable to brain imaging. To demonstrate the power of the technique, we present high-resolution retinotopic maps of five visual areas in mouse cortex and orientation maps in cat visual cortex.},

	Abstract = {During early visual processing the eyes can be captured by salient visual information in the environment. Whether a salient stimulus captures the eyes in a purely automatic, bottom-up fashion or whether capture is contingent on task demands is still under debate. In the first experiment, we manipulated the relevance of a salient onset distractor. The onset distractor could either be similar or dissimilar to the target. Error saccade latency distributions showed that early in time, oculomotor capture was driven purely bottom-up irrespective of distractor similarity. Later in time, top-down information became available resulting in contingent capture. In the second experiment, we manipulated the saliency information at the target location. A salient onset stimulus could be presented either at the target or at a non-target location. The latency distributions of error and correct saccades had a similar time-course as those observed in the first experiment. Initially, the distributions overlapped but later in time task-relevant information decelerated the oculomotor system. The present findings reveal the interaction between bottom-up and top-down processes in oculomotor behavior. We conclude that the task relevance of a salient event is not crucial for capture of the eyes to occur. Moreover, task-relevant information may integrate with saliency information to initiate saccades, but only later in time.},

	Abstract = {By using meaningful stimuli, multisensory research has recently started to investigate the impact of stimulus content on crossmodal integration. Variations in this respect have often been termed as "semantic". In this paper we will review work related to the question for which tasks the influence of semantic factors has been found and which cortical networks are most likely to mediate these effects. More specifically, the focus of this paper will be on processing of object stimuli presented in the auditory and visual sensory modalities. Furthermore, we will investigate which cortical regions are particularly responsive to experimental variations of content by comparing semantically matching ("congruent") and mismatching ("incongruent") experimental conditions. In this context, recent neuroimaging studies point toward a possible functional differentiation of temporal and frontal cortical regions, with the former being more responsive to semantically congruent and the latter to semantically incongruent audio-visual (AV) stimulation. To account for these differential effects, we will suggest in the final section of this paper a possible synthesis of these data on semantic modulation of AV integration with findings from neuroimaging studies and theoretical accounts of semantic memory.},

	Abstract = {How do we decide where to look next? During natural, active vision, we move our eyes to gather task-relevant information from the visual scene. Information theory provides an elegant framework for investigating how visual stimulus information combines with prior knowledge and task goals to plan an eye movement. We measured eye movements as observers performed a shape-learning and -matching task, for which the task-relevant information was tightly controlled. Using computational models, we probe the underlying strategies used by observers when planning their next eye movement. One strategy is to move the eyes to locations that maximize the total information gained about the shape, which is equivalent to reducing global uncertainty. Observers' behavior may appear highly similar to this strategy, but a rigorous analysis of sequential fixation placement reveals that observers may instead be using a local rule: fixate only the most informative locations, that is, reduce local uncertainty.},

In Experiment 1, participants discriminated the elevation of visual targets preceded by either unimodal or bimodal cues under conditions of either a high perceptual load (involving the monitoring of a rapidly presented central stream of visual letters for occasionally presented target digits) or no perceptual load (when the central stream was replaced by a fixation point). All of the cues captured spatial attention in the no-load condition, whereas only the bimodal cues captured visuospatial attention in the high-load condition. In Experiment 2, we ruled out the possibility that the presentation of any changing stimulus at fixation (i.e., a passively monitored stream of letters) would eliminate exogenous orienting, which instead appears to be a consequence of high perceptual load conditions (Experiment 1). These results demonstrate that multisensory cues capture spatial attention more effectively than unimodal cues under conditions of concurrent perceptual load.},

	Abstract = {CONTEXT: The gene that codes for cannabinoid receptor 1 (CNR1) represents an important target for investigations designed to elucidate individual differences in the etiology of alcohol dependence. OBJECTIVE: To achieve a better understanding of the role of the CNR1 gene in the etiology and treatment of alcohol dependence. DESIGN: The present investigation spans multiple levels of analysis, including receptor binding in postmortem brain tissue, neuroimaging, human laboratory models, and analyses of treatment outcome data. RESULTS: Findings indicate that the C allele of rs2023239 is associated with greater CB1 binding in the prefrontal cortex, greater alcohol cue-elicited brain activation in the midbrain and prefrontal cortex, greater subjective reward when consuming alcohol, and more positive outcomes after treatment with a medication that targets the mesocorticolimbic neurocircuitry. In addition, there were strong correlations between cue-elicited brain activation and alcohol consumption measures in individuals with the C allele. CONCLUSION: Individuals with the C allele may be more susceptible to changes in the mesocorticolimbic neurocircuitry that is involved in the attribution of incentive salience after repeated exposure to alcohol.},

	Abstract = {Neuronal responses to static and moving texture patterns were investigated in the striate cortex of anaesthetized and paralysed adults cats. Texture patterns were composed of a central light bar presented in the excitatory receptive field of a cell and an array of many similar elements in the surround. For the static condition, elements in the surround were either parallel or orthogonal to the centre line (orientation test). For the moving condition, centre and surround elements (all at same orientation) moved either in the same or in the opposite directions (motion test). Thirty-six percent (31/86) of the neurons tested for motion and 24% (24/99) of the neurons tested for orientation responded more strongly to the patterns displaying feature contrast than to the uniform patterns. These neurons may form a neural basis for visual pop-out of orientation and motion.},

	Abstract = {Computational models of primary visual cortex have demonstrated that principles of efficient coding and neuronal sparseness can explain the emergence of neurones with localised oriented receptive fields. Yet, existing models have failed to predict the diverse shapes of receptive fields that occur in nature. The existing models used a particular "soft" form of sparseness that limits average neuronal activity. Here we study models of efficient coding in a broader context by comparing soft and "bard" forms of neuronal sparseness. As a result of our analyses, we propose a novel network model for visual cortex. The model forms efficient visual representations in which the number of active neurones, rather than mean neuronal activity, is limited. This form of hard sparseness also economises cortical resources like synaptic memory and metabolic energy. Furthermore, our model accurately predicts the distribution of receptive field shapes found in the primary visual cortex of cat and monkey.},

	Abstract = {When we interact with objects in the world, the forces we exert are finely tuned to the dynamics of the situation. As our sensors do not provide perfect knowledge about the environment, a key problem is how to estimate the appropriate forces. Two sources of information can be used to generate such an estimate: sensory inputs about the object and knowledge about previously experienced objects, termed prior information. Bayesian integration defines the way in which these two sources of information should be combined to produce an optimal estimate. To investigate whether subjects use such a strategy in force estimation, we designed a novel sensorimotor estimation task. We controlled the distribution of forces experienced over the course of an experiment thereby defining the prior. We show that subjects integrate sensory information with their prior experience to generate an estimate. Moreover, subjects could learn different prior distributions. These results suggest that the CNS uses Bayesian models when estimating force requirements.},

	Abstract = {Objective: Denmark was an area of iodine deficiency, and mandatory iodine fortification of table salt and salt in bread (13 p.p.m. iodine) was initiated in 2000/2001. The Danish investigation on iodine intake and thyroid disease (DanThyr) is the monitoring of the iodine fortification program. Design and methods: DanThyr consists of three main parts: a study of population cohorts initialized before (n = 4649) and after (n = 3570) iodization of salt, a prospective identification of incident cases of overt hyper- and hypothyroidism in a population of around 550 000 people since 1997, and compilation of data from the national registers on the use of thyroid medication, thyroid surgery, and radioiodine therapy. Studies were carried-out in parallel in subcohorts living in areas with differences in iodine content of ground water. Results: The study showed profound effects of even small differences in iodine intake level on the prevalence of goiter, nodules, and thyroid dysfunction. Mild and moderate iodine deficiency was associated with a decrease in serum TSH with age. Other environmental factors were also important for goiter development (increase in risk, smoking and pregnancy; decrease in risk, oral contraception and alcohol consumption), and the individual risk depended on the genetic background. Environmental factors had only a minor influence on the prevalence of thyroid autoantibodies in the population. There were more cases of overt hypothyroidism in mild than in moderate iodine deficiency caused by a 53% higher incidence of spontaneous (presumably autoimmune) hypothyroidism. On the other hand, there were 49% more cases of overt hyperthyroidism in the area with moderate iodine deficiency. The cautious iodine fortification program, aiming at an average increase in iodine intake of 50 microg/day has been associated with a 50% increase in incidence of hyperthyroidism in the area with the most severe iodine deficiency. The incidence is expected to decrease in the future, but there may be more cases of Graves' hyperthyroidism in young people. Conclusion: A number of environmental factors influence the epidemiology of thyroid disorders, and even relatively small abnormalities and differences in the level of iodine intake of a population have profound effects on the occurrence of thyroid abnormalities. Monitoring and adjustment of iodine intake in the population is an important part of preventive medicine.},

Achieving this goal requires knowledge of both the characteristics of natural stimuli and the response properties of sensory neurons under natural stimulation. Most of our current notions of sensory processing have come from experiments using simple, parametric stimulus sets. However, a growing number of researchers have begun to question whether this approach alone is sufficient for understanding the real-life sensory tasks performed by the organism. Here, focusing on the early visual pathway, we argue that the use of natural stimuli is vital for advancing our understanding of sensory processing.},

	Abstract = {Paintings are the product of a process that begins with ordinary vision in the natural world and ends with manipulation of pigments on canvas. Because artists must produce images that can be seen by a visual system that is thought to take advantage of statistical regularities in natural scenes, artists are likely to replicate many of these regularities in their painted art. We have tested this notion by computing basic statistical properties and modeled cell response properties for a large set of digitized paintings and natural scenes. We find that both representational and non-representational (abstract) paintings from our sample (124 images) show basic similarities to a sample of natural scenes in terms of their spatial frequency amplitude spectra, but the paintings and natural scenes show significantly different mean amplitude spectrum slopes. We also find that the intensity distributions of paintings show a lower skewness and sparseness than natural scenes. We account for this by considering the range of luminances found in the environment compared to the range available in the medium of paint. A painting's range is limited by the reflective properties of its materials. We argue that artists do not simply scale the intensity range down but use a compressive nonlinearity. In our studies, modeled retinal and cortical filter responses to the images were less sparse for the paintings than for the natural scenes. But when a compressive nonlinearity was applied to the images, both the paintings' sparseness and the modeled responses to the paintings showed the same or greater sparseness compared to the natural scenes. This suggests that artists achieve some degree of nonlinear compression in their paintings. Because paintings have captivated humans for millennia, finding basic statistical regularities in paintings' spatial structure could grant insights into the range of spatial patterns that humans find compelling.},

	Abstract = {Explorations of learning and memory, other long-term plastic changes, and additional cognitive functions in the behaving primate brain would greatly benefit from the ability to image the functional architecture within the same patch of cortex, at the columnar level, for a long period of time. We developed methods for long-term optical imaging based on intrinsic signals and repeatedly visualized the same functional domains in behaving macaque cortex for a period extending over 1 year. Using optical imaging and imaging spectroscopy, we first explored the relationship between electrical activity and hemodynamic events in the awake behaving primate and compared it with anesthetized preparations. We found that, whereas the amplitude of the intrinsic signal was much larger in the awake animal, its temporal pattern was similar to that observed in the anesthetized animals. In both groups, deoxyhemoglobin concentration reached a peak 2-3 sec after stimulus onset. Furthermore, the early activity-dependent increase in deoxyhemoglobin concentration (the "initial dip") was far more tightly colocalized with electrical activity than the delayed increase in oxyhemoglobin concentration, known to be associated with an increase in blood flow. The implications of these results for improvement of the spatial resolution of blood oxygenation level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging are discussed. After the characterization of the intrinsic signal in the behaving primate, we used this new imaging method to explore the stability of cortical maps in the macaque primary visual cortex. Functional maps of orientation and ocular dominance columns were found to be stable for a period longer than 1 year.},

	Abstract = {Interactions between stimulus-induced oscillations (35-80 Hz) and stimulus-locked nonoscillatory responses were investigated in the visual cortex areas 17 and 18 of anaesthetized cats. A single square-wave luminance grating was used as a visual stimulus during simultaneous recordings from up to seven electrodes. The stimulus movement consisted of a superposition of a smooth movement with a sequence of dynamically changing accelerations. Responses of local groups of neurons at each electrode were studied on the basis of multiple unit activity and local slow field potentials (13-120 Hz). Oscillatory and stimulus-locked components were extracted from multiple unit activity and local slow field potentials and quantified by a combination of temporal and spectral correlation methods. We found fast stimulus-locked components primarily evoked by sudden stimulus accelerations, whereas oscillatory components (35-80 Hz) were induced during slow smooth movements. Oscillations were gradually reduced in amplitude and finally fully suppressed with increasing amplitudes of fast stimulus-locked components. It is argued that suppression of oscillations is necessary to prevent confusion during sequential processing of stationary and fast changing retinal images.},

In the first experiment it was shown that specific perceptual interpretations of an ambiguous picture usually correlate with parameters of the gaze-position distributions. In the second experiment these distributions were used for an image processing of initial pictures in such a way that in regions which attracted less fixations the brightness of all elements was lowered. The preprocessed pictures were then shown to a group of 150 naive subjects for an identification. The results of this experiment demonstrated that in four out of six pictures it was possible to influence perception of other persons in the predicted way, ie to shift spontaneous reports of naive subjects in the direction of interpretations that accompanied gaze-position data used for the preprocessing of initial pictures. Possible reasons for a failure of such a communication of personal views in two cases are also discussed.},

	Abstract = {Human speech perception is profoundly influenced by vision. Watching a speaker's mouth movements significantly improves comprehension, both for normal listeners in noisy environments and especially for the hearing impaired. A number of brain regions have been implicated in audiovisual speech tasks, but little evidence distinguishes them functionally. In an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging study, we differentiate neural systems that evaluate cross-modal coincidence of the physical stimuli from those that mediate perceptual binding. Regions consistently involved in perceptual fusion per se included Heschl's gyrus, superior temporal sulcus, middle intraparietal sulcus, and inferior frontal gyrus. Successful fusion elicited activity biased toward the left hemisphere, although failed cross-modal binding recruited regions in both hemispheres. A broad network of other areas, including the superior colliculus, anterior insula, and anterior intraparietal sulcus, were more involved with evaluating the spatiotemporal correspondence of speech stimuli, regardless of a subject's perception. All of these showed greater activity to temporally offset stimuli than to audiovisually synchronous stimuli. Our results demonstrate how elements of the cross-modal speech integration network differ in their sensitivity to physical reality versus perceptual experience.},

@article{graham2008a,
	Abstract = {Two recent studies suggest that natural scenes and paintings show similar statistical properties. But does the content or region of origin of an artwork affect its statistical properties? We addressed this question by having judges place paintings from a large, diverse collection of paintings into one of three subject-matter categories using a forced-choice paradigm. Basic statistics for images whose caterogization was agreed by all judges showed no significant differences between those judged to be 'landscape' and 'portrait/still-life', but these two classes differed from paintings judged to be 'abstract'. All categories showed basic spatial statistical regularities similar to those typical of natural scenes. A test of the full painting collection (140 images) with respect to the works' place of origin (provenance) showed significant differences between Eastern works and Western ones, differences which we find are likely related to the materials and the choice of background color. Although artists deviate slightly from reproducing natural statistics in abstract art (compared to representational art), the great majority of human art likely shares basic statistical limitations. We argue that statistical regularities in art are rooted in the need to make art visible to the eye, not in the inherent aesthetic value of natural-scene statistics, and we suggest that variability in spatial statistics may be generally imposed by manufacture.},

	Abstract = {Although pointing is not part of great apes' natural gestural repertoire, they can learn to point to food, in order to request it. To assess the flexibility with which they can use this gesture, one can vary the potential referent of the point. In two previous studies, three orangutans (two of them human-reared) have shown the ability to point to the location of a tool which a human experimenter needed in order to give them food. Here, we tested six orangutans and five bonobos using a set-up in which our subjects had to guide a human experimenter to the hiding place of a fork which was needed in order to retrieve a piece of food for the subject out of a vertical tube. We further examined the potential role of a competitive/deceptive context by varying the identity of the person responsible for hiding the tool. In addition, we implemented three different control conditions in which an object was hidden but it was not necessary to indicate its location to get the food. We found that the majority of subjects spontaneously guided the experimenter to the hiding place of the fork by pointing to it when it was necessary and they did so significantly less in control conditions. We did not find an effect of the person hiding the fork. Our results show that mother-reared orangutans and bonobos are able to point to inform a human about the location of an object that the human needs to procure food for the subject and that they can take into account whether it is relevant or not to do so.},

As a first step to examine this issue we investigated the spatial relationships between the orientation, ocular dominance, and spatial frequency domains in cat area 17. Using optical imaging of intrinsic signals we obtained high resolution maps for each of these stimulus features from the same cortical regions. We found clear relationships between orientation and ocular dominance columns: many iso-orientation lines intersected the borders between ocular dominance borders at right angles, and orientation singularities were concentrated in the center regions of the ocular dominance columns. Similar, albeit weaker geometric relationships were observed between the orientation and spatial frequency domains. The ocular dominance and spatial frequency maps were also found to be spatially related: there was a tendency for the low spatial frequency domains to avoid the border regions of the ocular dominance columns. This specific arrangement of the different columnar systems might ensure that all possible combinations of stimulus features are represented at least once in any given region of the visual cortex, thus avoiding the occurrence of functional blind spots for a particular stimulus attribute in the visual field.},

	Abstract = {We analyzed the extracellular responses of 70 V1 neurons (recorded in 3 anesthetized macaque monkeys) to a single oriented line segment (or bar) placed within the cell classical receptive field (RF), or center of the RF. These responses could be modulated when rings of bars were placed entirely outside, but around the RF (the "near" surround region), as described in previous studies. Suppression was the main effect. The response was enhanced for 12 neurons when orthogonal bars in the surround were presented instead of bars having the same orientation as the center bar. This orientation contrast property is possibly involved in the mediation of perceptual pop-out. The enhancement was delayed compared with the onset of the response by about 40 ms. We also observed a suppression originating specifically from the flanks of the surround. This "side-inhibition," significant for nine neurons, was delayed by about 20 ms. We tested whether these center/surround interactions in V1 depend on feedback connections from area V2. V2 was inactivated by GABA injections. We used devices made of six micropipettes to inactivate the convergent zone from V2 to V1. We could reliably inactivate a 2- to 4-mm-wide region of V2. Inactivation of V2 had no effect on the center/surround interactions of V1 neurons, even those that were delayed. Therefore the center/surround interactions of V1 neurons that might be involved in pop-out do not appear to depend on feedback connections from V2, at least in the anesthetized monkey. We conclude that these properties are probably shaped by long-range connections within V1 or depend on other feedback connections. The main effect of V2 inactivation was a decrease of the response to the single bar for about 10% of V1 neurons. The decrease was delayed by <20 ms after the response onset. Even the earliest neurons to respond could be affected by the feedback from V2. Together with the results on feedback connections from MT (previous paper), these findings show that feedback connections potentiate the responses to stimulation of the RF center and are recruited very early for the treatment of visual information.},

	Abstract = {Chemokines are a group of small proteins that recruit different leukocyte subtypes to sites of inflammation and play important roles in initiating and maintaining immunological responses in autoimmune endocrine diseases including Graves' disease (GD) and Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT). Previous studies have found increased gene and protein expression of different kinds of chemokines not only within the thyroid gland but also within thyroid cells in GD or HT patients. A few studies have determined serum levels of chemokines, with conflicting results. We measured circulating concentrations of CCL2, CCL5, CXCL9, and CXCL10 in patients with GD, HT, and nontoxic nodular thyroid disease (NNT). While CCL2 and CXCL9 concentrations were comparable in patients with either AITD or NNT, CCL5 was significantly increased in GD patients compared with HT or NNT subjects. In contrast, CXCL10 levels were lower in patients with GD, but the difference was statistically significant only when compared with patients with HT (p=0.0018). Importantly, GD patients who relapsed or went into remission had significantly different levels of CXCL9 (p=0.0252). Serum levels of CCL2, CCL5, CXCL9, and CXCL10 did not reveal any correlation with thyroid volume; with the levels of thyrotropin (TSH), FT3, or FT4; or with the titers of TSH receptor antibody and thyroperoxidase antibody. These data suggest that the expression patterns of chemokines in various thyroid diseases differ from each other, which may reflect the distinct immune responses in HT and GD.},

	Abstract = {Modulation of the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) by attention was studied in detail using 15 'tag' frequencies in the range of 2.5-20 Hz. The stimuli were two series of random disc search arrays superimposed on two concentric color-marked annuli respectively. Two series of arrays were updated independently; one updated at one fixed frequency (flicker) and the other updated randomly according to a white noise distribution (random broadband flicker, rbbf). On each trial, the observer was instructed to attend one annulus and to detect a target (a triangle) that occasionally appeared in a random disc array in the attended annulus. The SSVEP results show that the choice of flicker frequency selects which cortical network synchronizes to the flicker two distinct cortical networks showed different effects of attention. SSVEP power and the effects of attention on SSVEP power strongly depend on both flicker frequency and radial position of rbbf annulus. At flicker frequencies in the delta band (2-4 Hz), and in the upper alpha band (10-11 Hz), an occipital-frontal network appears to phase-lock to the flicker when attending to the flicker, increasing the magnitude of the SSVEP. At flicker frequencies in the lower alpha band (8-10 Hz), a global response to a peripheral flickering stimulus, that includes parietal cortex and posterior frontal cortex, has higher amplitude when attention is directed away from the flickering peripheral stimulus and towards a competing rbbf stimulus in the fovea. Increases in SSVEP power when attention is directed to peripheral flicker are always associated with increases in phase locking. By contrast, at frequencies in the lower alpha band, increases in SSVEP power when attention is directed away from the flicker and towards foveal stimuli are not associated with changes in phase-locking. Thus, whether attention to a flicker stimulus increases or decreases SSVEP amplitude and phase locking depends on which of two cortical networks, which have distinct spatial and dynamic properties, is selected by the flicker frequency.},

	Abstract = {Tactile pattern recognition depends on form and texture perception. A principal dimension of texture perception is roughness, the neural coding of which was the focus of this study. Previous studies have shown that perceived roughness is not based on neural activity in the Pacinian or cutaneous slowly adapting type II (SAII) neural responses or on mean impulse rate or temporal patterning in the cutaneous slowly adapting type I (SAI) or rapidly adapting (RA) discharge evoked by a textured surface. However, those studies found very high correlations between roughness scaling by humans and measures of spatial variation in SAI and RA firing rates. The present study used textured surfaces composed of dots of varying height (280-620 micron) and diameter (0.25-2.5 mm) in psychophysical and neurophysiological experiments. RA responses were affected least by the range of dot diameters and heights that produced the widest variation in perceived roughness, and these responses could not account for the psychophysical data. In contrast, spatial variation in SAI impulse rate was correlated closely with perceived roughness over the whole stimulus range, and a single measure of SAI spatial variation accounts for the psychophysical data in this (0.974 correlation) and two previous studies. Analyses based on the possibility that perceived roughness depends on both afferent types suggest that if the RA response plays a role in roughness perception, it is one of mild inhibition. These data reinforce the hypothesis that SAI afferents are mainly responsible for information about form and texture whereas RA afferents are mainly responsible for information about flutter, slip, and motion across the skin surface.},

This map appears to be distributed across areas of the visual cortex, and is closely linked to the oculomotor system that controls eye movements and orients the gaze to locations in the visual scene characterized by a high salience.},

Clock circuitry is uniquely positioned to coordinate interactions between processes underlying memory and sleep need. Flies increase sleep both after exposure to an enriched social environment and after protocols that induce long-term memory. We found that flies mutant for rutabaga, period, and blistered were deficient for experience-dependent increases in sleep. Rescue of each of these genes within the ventral lateral neurons (LNVs) restores increased sleep after social enrichment. Social experiences that induce increased sleep were associated with an increase in the number of synaptic terminals in the LNV projections into the medulla. The number of synaptic terminals was reduced during sleep and this decline was prevented by sleep deprivation.},

	Abstract = {When natural scenes are viewed, a multitude of objects that are stable in their environments are brought in and out of view by eye movements. The posterior parietal cortex is crucial for the analysis of space, visual attention and movement. Neurons in one of its subdivisions, the lateral intraparietal area (LIP), have visual responses to stimuli appearing abruptly at particular retinal locations (their receptive fields). We have tested the responses of LIP neurons to stimuli that entered their receptive field by saccades. Neurons had little or no response to stimuli brought into their receptive field by saccades, unless the stimuli were behaviourally significant. We established behavioural significance in two ways: either by making a stable stimulus task-relevant, or by taking advantage of the attentional attraction of an abruptly appearing stimulus. Our results show that under ordinary circumstances the entire visual world is only weakly represented in LIP. The visual representation in LIP is sparse, with only the most salient or behaviourally relevant objects being strongly represented.},

	Abstract = {Exploring visual illusions reveals fundamental principles of cortical processing. Illusory motion perception of non-moving stimuli was described almost a century ago by Gestalt psychologists. However, the underlying neuronal mechanisms remain unknown. To explore cortical mechanisms underlying the 'line-motion' illusion, we used real-time optical imaging, which is highly sensitive to subthreshold activity. We examined, in the visual cortex of the anaesthetized cat, responses to five stimuli: a stationary small square and a long bar; a moving square; a drawn-out bar; and the well-known line-motion illusion, a stationary square briefly preceding a long stationary bar presentation. Whereas flashing the bar alone evoked the expected localized, short latency and high amplitude activity patterns, presenting a square 60-100 ms before a bar induced the dynamic activity patterns resembling that of fast movement. The preceding square, even though physically non-moving, created gradually propagating subthreshold cortical activity that must contribute to illusory motion, because it was indistinguishable from cortical representations of real motion in this area. These findings demonstrate the effect of spatio-temporal patterns of subthreshold synaptic potentials on cortical processing and the shaping of perception.},

	Abstract = {To study the association between smoking and thyroid disease (Graves' disease [E05.0], nodular toxic goiter [E05.2], and autoimmune hypothyroidism [E03.9]) in a low-iodine intake area a case-control study was undertaken. A self-administered questionnaire was issued to 864 consecutive patients with hyperthyroidism and 628 patients with autoimmune hypothyroidism treated at five university or regional endocrinologic clinics in Denmark between January 1, 1990 and December 31, 1998. Each respondent was compared to an age- (+/- 5 years) and gender-matched normal control person randomly drawn from the background population. A total of 621 patients with hyperthyroidism (72%) and 411 patients with autoimmune hypothyroidism (66%) responded. Of these, 617 (542 females) and 408 (364 females) could be analyzed, respectively. There was an increased risk of both Graves' disease (odds ratio [OR] = 2.5, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.8-3.5), toxic nodular goiter (OR = 1.7, 95% CI: 1.1-2.5), and autoimmune hypothyroidism (OR = 1.5, 95% CI: 1.1-2.1) with ever smoking compared to never smoking in women, but not in men. With the high proportion of ever-smokers among women (56%), the attributable risk of smoking in women was 45% in Graves' disease, 28% in toxic nodular goiter, and 23% in autoimmune hypothyroidism. Ever use of oral contraceptives was associated with a slightly lower risk of Graves' disease in women, but not of toxic nodular goiter or autoimmune hypothyroidism. In conclusion, smoking is a powerful risk factor for thyroid disease, especially in populations with a high smoking frequency. Oral contraceptive use is associated with a slightly lower frequency of Graves' disease.},

	Abstract = {Mammals acquire much of their sensory information by actively moving their sensory organs. Rats, in particular, scan their surrounding environment with their whiskers. This form of active sensing induces specific patterns of temporal encoding of sensory information, which are based on a conversion of space into time via sensor movement. We investigate the ways in which object location is encoded by the whiskers and decoded by the brain. We recorded from first-order neurons located in the trigeminal ganglion (TG) of anaesthetized rats during epochs of artificial whisking induced by electrical stimulation of the facial motor nerve. We found that TG neurons encode the three positional coordinates with different codes. The horizontal coordinate (along the backward-forward axis) is encoded by two encoding schemes, both relying on the firing times of one type of TG neuron, the 'contact cell'. The radial coordinate (from face outward) is encoded primarily by the firing magnitude of another type of TG neurons, the 'pressure cell'. The vertical coordinate (from ground up) is encoded by the identity of activated neurons. The decoding schemes of at least some of these sensory cues, our data suggest, are also active: cortical representations are generated by a thalamic comparison of cortical expectations with incoming sensory data.},

	Abstract = {Altogether, thyroid function abnormalities during pregnancy can affect up to 10% of all women. The high prevalence of both hypo- and hyperthyroidism, the obstetrical repercussions associated with thyroid dysfunction in the mothers, as well as the potential role of maternal thyroid dysfunction as an influence on fetal development constitute solid arguments for a further increase of our knowledge of the pathophysiological processes underlying the alterations of thyroid function related to the pregnant state. In this review, the focus will be on the most clinically relevant aspects associated with hypothyroidism [autoimmune thyroid disorders (AITDs), subfertility, risk of miscarriage, risk of hypothyroidism in women with AITD and treatment of hypothyroid women] and with hyperthyroidism (clinical presentations during pregnancy, Graves' disease and its management, fetal hyperthyroidism in women with antithyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies and gestational transient thyrotoxicosis associated with human chorionic gonadotropin stimulation of the maternal thyroid gland). I also propose a global strategy for the systematic screening of hypo- and hyperthyroidism in the pregnant state.},

@article{reinagel2000a,
	Abstract = {The amount of information a sensory neuron carries about a stimulus is directly related to response reliability. We recorded from individual neurons in the cat lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) while presenting randomly modulated visual stimuli. The responses to repeated stimuli were reproducible, whereas the responses evoked by nonrepeated stimuli drawn from the same ensemble were variable. Stimulus-dependent information was quantified directly from the difference in entropy of these neural responses. We show that a single LGN cell can encode much more visual information than had been demonstrated previously, ranging from 15 to 102 bits/sec across our sample of cells. Information rate was correlated with the firing rate of the cell, for a consistent rate of 3.6 +/- 0.6 bits/spike (mean +/- SD). This information can primarily be attributed to the high temporal precision with which firing probability is modulated; many individual spikes were timed with better than 1 msec precision. We introduce a way to estimate the amount of information encoded in temporal patterns of firing, as distinct from the information in the time varying firing rate at any temporal resolution. Using this method, we find that temporal patterns sometimes introduce redundancy but often encode visual information. The contribution of temporal patterns ranged from -3.4 to +25.5 bits/sec or from -9.4 to +24.9% of the total information content of the responses.},

	Abstract = {We studied human movement planning in tasks in which subjects selected one of two goals that differed in expected gain. Each goal configuration consisted of a target circle and a partially overlapping penalty circle. Rapid hits into the target region led to a monetary bonus; accidental hits into the penalty region incurred a penalty. The outcomes assigned to target and penalty regions and the spatial arrangement of those regions were varied. Subjects preferred configurations with higher expected gain whether selection involved a rapid pointing movement or a choice by key press. Movements executed to select one of two goal configurations exhibited the same movement dynamics as pointing movements directed at a single configuration, and were executed with the same high efficiency. Our results suggest that humans choose near-optimal strategies when planning their movement, and can base their selection of strategy on a rapid judgment about the expected gain associated with possible movement goals.},

	Abstract = {Covert attention can lead to improved performance in perceptual tasks. The neural and functional mechanisms of covert attention are still under investigation. Using both rapid event-related and mixed designs, we measured the blood oxygenation level-dependent functional MRI contrast response functions over the full range of contrast (0-100%) in the retinotopically defined early visual areas (V1, V2, V3, V3A, and V4) in humans. Covert attention increased both the baseline activities and contrast gains in the five cortical areas. The effect on baseline can be decomposed into a transient trial-by-trial component and a component across an entire attention block. On average, increase in contrast gain accounted for approximately 88.0%, 28.5%, 12.7%, 35.9%, and 25.2% of the trial-by-trial effects of attention in the five areas, respectively, and 22.2%, 12.8%, 7.4%, 19.7%, and 17.3% of the total effects of attention in those areas, consistent with single-unit findings in V4 and MT.

Yet people appear to lack the ability to discriminate accelerations accurately. This study supports the idea that outfielders convert the temporal problem to a spatial one by selecting a running path that maintains a linear optical trajectory (LOT) for the ball. The LOT model is a strategy of maintaining "control" over the relative direction of optical ball movement in a manner that is similar to simple predator tracking behavior.},

	Abstract = {Numerous studies show that practice can result in performance improvements on low-level visual perceptual tasks [1-5]. However, such learning is characteristically difficult and slow, requiring many days of training [6-8]. Here, we show that a multisensory audiovisual training procedure facilitates visual learning and results in significantly faster learning than unisensory visual training. We trained one group of subjects with an audiovisual motion-detection task and a second group with a visual motion-detection task, and compared performance on trials containing only visual signals across ten days of training. Whereas observers in both groups showed improvements of visual sensitivity with training, subjects trained with multisensory stimuli showed significantly more learning both within and across training sessions. These benefits of multisensory training are particularly surprising given that the learning of visual motion stimuli is generally thought to be mediated by low-level visual brain areas [6, 9, 10]. Although crossmodal interactions are ubiquitous in human perceptual processing [11-13], the contribution of crossmodal information to perceptual learning has not been studied previously. Our results show that multisensory interactions can be exploited to yield more efficient learning of sensory information and suggest that multisensory training programs would be most effective for the acquisition of new skills.},

	Abstract = {During sensory processing, cortical areas continuously exchange information in different directions along the hierarchy. The functional role of such interactions, however, has been the subject of various proposals. Here, we investigate the role of bottom-up and top-down interactions in processing stimulus structure and their relation to expected events. Applying multivariate autoregressive methods to local field potentials recorded in alert cats, we quantify directed interactions between primary (A17/18) and higher (A21) visual areas. A trial-by-trial analysis yields the following findings. To assess the role of interareal interactions in processing stimulus structure, we recorded in naive animals during stimulation with natural movies and pink noise stimuli. The overall interactions decrease compared with baseline for both stimuli. To investigate whether forthcoming events modulate interactions, we recorded in trained animals viewing two stimuli, one of which had been associated with a reward. Several results support such modulations. First, the interactions increase compared with baseline and this increase is not observed in a context where food was not delivered. Second, these stimuli have a differential effect on top-down and bottom-up components. This difference is emphasized during the stimulus presentation and is maximal shortly before the possible reward. Furthermore, a spectral decomposition of the interactions shows that this asymmetry is most dominant in the gamma frequency range. Concluding, these results support the notion that interareal interactions are more related to an expectancy state rather than to processing of stimulus structure.},

	Abstract = {It has been proposed that the visual system encodes the salience of objects in the visual field in an explicit two-dimensional map that guides visual selective attention. Experiments were conducted to determine whether salience measurements applied to regions of pictures of outdoor scenes could predict the detection of changes in those regions. To obtain a quantitative measure of change detection, observers located changes in pairs of colour pictures presented across an interstimulus interval (ISI). Salience measurements were then obtained from different observers for image change regions using three independent methods, and all were positively correlated with change detection. Factor analysis extracted a single saliency factor that accounted for 62% of the variance contained in the four measures. Finally, estimates of the magnitude of the image change in each picture pair were obtained, using nine separate visual filters representing low-level vision features (luminance, colour, spatial frequency, orientation, edge density). None of the feature outputs was significantly associated with change detection or saliency. On the other hand it was shown that high-level (structural) properties of the changed region were related to saliency and to change detection: objects were more salient than shadows and more detectable when changed.},

	Abstract = {Now that the study of consciousness is warmly embraced by cognitive scientists, much confusion seems to arise between the concepts of visual attention and visual awareness. Often, visual awareness is equated to what is in the focus of attention. There are, however, two sets of arguments to separate attention from awareness: a psychological/theoretical one and a neurobiological one. By combining these arguments I present definitions of visual attention and awareness that clearly distinguish between the two, yet explain why attention and awareness are so intricately related. In fact, there seems more overlap between mechanisms of memory and awareness than between those of attention and awareness.},

	Abstract = {The visual image formed on the retina represents an amalgam of visual scene properties, including the reflectances of surfaces, their relative positions, and the type of illumination. The challenge facing the visual system is to extract the "meaning" of the image by decomposing it into its environmental causes. For each local region of the image, that extraction of meaning is only possible if information from other regions is taken into account. Of particular importance is a set of image cues revealing surface occlusion and/or lighting conditions. These information-rich cues direct the perceptual interpretation of other more ambiguous image regions. This context-dependent transformation from image to perception has profound-but frequently under-appreciated-implications for neurophysiological studies of visual processing: To demonstrate that neuronal responses are correlated with perception of visual scene properties, rather than visual image features, neuronal sensitivity must be assessed in varied contexts that differentially influence perceptual interpretation. We review a number of recent studies that have used this context-based approach to explore the neuronal bases of visual scene perception.},

	Abstract = {Our perception of the environment relies on the capacity of neural networks to adapt rapidly to changes in incoming stimuli. It is increasingly being realized that the neural code is adaptive, that is, sensory neurons change their responses and selectivity in a dynamic manner to match the changes in input stimuli. Understanding how rapid exposure, or adaptation, to a stimulus of fixed structure changes information processing by cortical networks is essential for understanding the relationship between sensory coding and behaviour. Physiological investigations of adaptation have contributed greatly to our understanding of how individual sensory neurons change their responses to influence stimulus coding, yet whether and how adaptation affects information coding in neural populations is unknown. Here we examine how brief adaptation (on the timescale of visual fixation) influences the structure of interneuronal correlations and the accuracy of population coding in the macaque (Macaca mulatta) primary visual cortex (V1). We find that brief adaptation to a stimulus of fixed structure reorganizes the distribution of correlations across the entire network by selectively reducing their mean and variability. The post-adaptation changes in neuronal correlations are associated with specific, stimulus-dependent changes in the efficiency of the population code, and are consistent with changes in perceptual performance after adaptation. Our results have implications beyond the predictions of current theories of sensory coding, suggesting that brief adaptation improves the accuracy of population coding to optimize neuronal performance during natural viewing.},

Cross-correlation of spontaneous fluctuations in membrane potential revealed significant correlations between the cells in each pair. This synchronization was not dependent on the occurrence of action potentials, indicating that it was not caused by mutual interconnections. The cells were synchronized continuously rather than for brief epochs. Much weaker correlations were found between the EEG and intracellular potentials, suggesting local, rather than global, synchrony. The highest correlation occurred among cells with similar connectivity from the LGN and similar receptive fields. During visual stimulation, correlations increased when both cells responded to the stimulus and decreased when neither cell responded.},

@article{molholm2004a,
	Abstract = {Multisensory object-recognition processes were investigated by examining the combined influence of visual and auditory inputs upon object identification--in this case, pictures and vocalizations of animals. Behaviorally, subjects were significantly faster and more accurate at identifying targets when the picture and vocalization were matched (i.e. from the same animal), than when the target was represented in only one sensory modality. This behavioral enhancement was accompanied by a modulation of the evoked potential in the latency range and general topographic region of the visual evoked N1 component, which is associated with early feature processing in the ventral visual stream. High-density topographic mapping and dipole modeling of this multisensory effect were consistent with generators in lateral occipito-temporal cortices, suggesting that auditory inputs were modulating processing in regions of the lateral occipital cortices. Both the timing and scalp topography of this modulation suggests that there are multisensory effects during what is considered to be a relatively early stage of visual object-recognition processes, and that this modulation occurs in regions of the visual system that have traditionally been held to be unisensory processing areas. Multisensory inputs also modulated the visual 'selection-negativity', an attention dependent component of the evoked potential this is usually evoked when subjects selectively attend to a particular feature of a visual stimulus.},

This chapter presents a framework for thinking about attention that facilitates the analysis of this cognitive process in terms of underlying neural mechanisms. Four processes are fundamental to attention: working memory, top-down sensitivity control, competitive selection, and automatic bottom-up filtering for salient stimuli. Each process makes a distinct and essential contribution to attention. Voluntary control of attention involves the first three processes (working memory, top-down sensitivity control, and competitive selection) operating in a recurrent loop. Recent results from neurobiological research on attention are discussed within this framework.},

Their most common manifestation is resistance to TSH; they may also be the cause of a subset of cases of congenital hypothyroidism. Gain-of-function mutations are of greater theoretical interest. Somatic mutations constitutively activating the TSHr are the major cause of benign toxic thyroid adenomas, and of some cases of multinodular goiters. They underlie hereditary toxic thyroid hyperplasia, and have been found in cases of sporadic congenital non-autoimmune hyperthyroidism. A role for TSHr polymorphisms in Graves' disease has not been documented.},

@article{rao2002a,
	Abstract = {Visual cognition depends critically on the moment-to-moment orientation of gaze. To change the gaze to a new location in space, that location must be computed and used by the oculomotor system. One of the most common sources of information for this computation is the visual appearance of an object. A crucial question is: How is the appearance information contained in the photometric array is converted into a target position? This paper proposes a such a model that accomplishes this calculation. The model uses iconic scene representations derived from oriented spatiochromatic filters at multiple scales. Visual search for a target object proceeds in a coarse-to-fine fashion with the target's largest scale filter responses being compared first. Task-relevant target locations are represented as saliency maps which are used to program eye movements. A central feature of the model is that it separates the targeting process, which changes gaze, from the decision process, which extracts information at or near the new gaze point to guide behavior. The model provides a detailed explanation for center-of-gravity saccades that have been observed in many previous experiments. In addition, the model's targeting performance has been compared with the eye movements of human subjects under identical conditions in natural visual search tasks. The results show good agreement both quantitatively (the search paths are strikingly similar) and qualitatively (the fixations of false targets are comparable).},

	Abstract = {To investigate the functional organization in the monkey inferotemporal cortex, which is the last exclusively visual area along the ventral visual cortical pathway, optical imaging based on intrinsic signals was carried out. We first conducted single-cell recordings with microelectrodes and determined the features critical for the activation of single cells. For the subsequent optical imaging, each critical feature was presented, which evoked multiple dark spots. Individual spots were approximately 0.5 mm in diameter and one of them covered the site of the electrode penetration at which the particular critical feature had been determined. The degree of stimulus selectivity varied from spot to spot, and from region to region even within a spot. Some regions were activated only by one of 12- 16 stimuli, while others by more than three stimuli. There were spots specifically activated by faces, and the position of activation spot changed gradually along the cortical surface as the stimulus face was rotated in depth. The length of the overall region along the direction of shift of these spots was approximately 1 mm. These results confirm the regional clustering of cells with similar stimulus selectivity and suggest larger units in which some parameters of object features are continuously mapped.},

	Abstract = {In this study, we characterize the adaptation of neurons in the cat lateral geniculate nucleus to changes in stimulus contrast and correlations. By comparing responses to high- and low-contrast natural scene movie and white noise stimuli, we show that an increase in contrast or correlations results in receptive fields with faster temporal dynamics and stronger antagonistic surrounds, as well as decreases in gain and selectivity. We also observe contrast- and correlation-induced changes in the reliability and sparseness of neural responses. We find that reliability is determined primarily by processing in the receptive field (the effective contrast of the stimulus), while sparseness is determined by the interactions between several functional properties.

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the significance of treatment with antithyroid drugs longer than 12 months on lasting remission in Graves' hyperthyroid patients, and to study clinical and laboratory parameters of prognostic value. PATIENTS: Fifty-two untreated Graves' hyperthyroid patients were assigned at random to two therapeutic groups. They were treated with carbimazole during 12 and 24 months in Group I (n = 28) and Group II (n = 24), respectively. MEASUREMENTS: Serum levels of FT4, T3, sTSH and TSH receptor antibody (TRAb) were measured before starting treatment and at regular intervals during treatment and follow-up after drug withdrawal. We compared the relapse rate in both groups of patients, at short (2-yr) and long-term (5-yr) periods after drug withdrawal. Also, we compared clinical and biochemical parameters between patients who stayed in remission and who had relapse. RESULTS: At the end of the short-term period, relapse had occurred in 13 (46.4%) Group I patients and in 13 (54.1%) Group II patients, p = 0.36. At the end of the long-term period, relapse had occurred in 24 (85.7%) Group I and 20 (83.3%) Group II patients, p = 0.78. No difference could be observed between patients who had stayed in remission and who had suffered relapse, within the 5-yr follow-up period regarding to goiter size, frequency of ophthalmopathy, TSH and TRAb levels. CONCLUSIONS: The high relapse rate observed could be due to high iodine intake in our country. In this study and in a review of the available data, we have been unable to find any rational basis for courses of antithyroid drugs longer than twelve months for the treatment of Graves' hyperthyroidism.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

	Abstract = {Arm movement is well represented in populations of neurons recorded from the motor cortex. Cortical activity patterns have been used in the new field of brain-machine interfaces to show how cursors on computer displays can be moved in two- and three-dimensional space. Although the ability to move a cursor can be useful in its own right, this technology could be applied to restore arm and hand function for amputees and paralysed persons. However, the use of cortical signals to control a multi-jointed prosthetic device for direct real-time interaction with the physical environment ('embodiment') has not been demonstrated. Here we describe a system that permits embodied prosthetic control; we show how monkeys (Macaca mulatta) use their motor cortical activity to control a mechanized arm replica in a self-feeding task. In addition to the three dimensions of movement, the subjects' cortical signals also proportionally controlled a gripper on the end of the arm. Owing to the physical interaction between the monkey, the robotic arm and objects in the workspace, this new task presented a higher level of difficulty than previous virtual (cursor-control) experiments. Apart from an example of simple one-dimensional control, previous experiments have lacked physical interaction even in cases where a robotic arm or hand was included in the control loop, because the subjects did not use it to interact with physical objects-an interaction that cannot be fully simulated. This demonstration of multi-degree-of-freedom embodied prosthetic control paves the way towards the development of dexterous prosthetic devices that could ultimately achieve arm and hand function at a near-natural level.},

	Abstract = {Investigations of the ways in which the eyes move came to prominence in the 19th century, but techniques for measuring them more precisely emerged in the 20th century. When scanning a scene or text the eyes engage in periods of relative stability (fixations) interspersed with ballistic rotations (saccades). The saccade-and-fixate strategy, associated with voluntary eye movements, was first uncovered in the context of involuntary eye movements following body rotation. This pattern of eye movements is now referred to as nystagmus, and involves periods of slow eye movements, during which objects are visible, and rapid returns, when they are not; it is based on a vestibular reflex which attempts to achieve image stabilisation. Post-rotational nystagmus was reported in the late 18th century (by Wells), with afterimages used as a means of retinal stabilisation to distinguish between movement of the eyes and of the environment. Nystagmus was linked to vestibular stimulation in the 19th century, and Mach, Breuer, and Crum Brown all described its fast and slow phases. Wells and Breuer proposed that there was no visual awareness during the ballistic phase (saccadic suppression). The saccade-and-fixate strategy highlighted by studies of nystagmus was shown to apply to tasks like reading by Dodge, who used more sophisticated photographic techniques to examine oculomotor kinematics. The relationship between eye movements and perception, following earlier intuitions by Wells and Breuer, was explored by Dodge, and has been of fundamental importance in the direction of vision research over the last century.},

	Abstract = {In studies of vision and audition, stimuli can be systematically varied by wavelength and frequency, respectively, but there is no equivalent metric for olfaction. Restricted odorant-feature metrics such as number of carbons and functional group do not account for response patterns to odorants varying along other structural dimensions. We generated a multidimensional odor metric, in which each odorant molecule was represented as a vector of 1,664 molecular descriptor values. Revisiting many studies, we found that this metric and a second optimized metric were always better at accounting for neural responses than the specific metric used in each study. These metrics were applicable across studies that differed in the animals studied, the type of olfactory neurons tested, the odorants applied and the recording methods used. We use this new metric to recommend sets of odorants that span the physicochemical space for use in olfaction experiments.},

	Abstract = {It has been suggested that saliency mechanisms play a role in perceptual organization. This work evaluates the plausibility of a recently proposed generic principle for visual saliency: that all saliency decisions are optimal in a decision-theoretic sense. The discriminant saliency hypothesis is combined with the classical assumption that bottom-up saliency is a center-surround process to derive a (decision-theoretic) optimal saliency architecture. Under this architecture, the saliency of each image location is equated to the discriminant power of a set of features with respect to the classification problem that opposes stimuli at center and surround. The optimal saliency detector is derived for various stimulus modalities, including intensity, color, orientation, and motion, and shown to make accurate quantitative predictions of various psychophysics of human saliency for both static and motion stimuli. These include some classical nonlinearities of orientation and motion saliency and a Weber law that governs various types of saliency asymmetries. The discriminant saliency detectors are also applied to various saliency problems of interest in computer vision, including the prediction of human eye fixations on natural scenes, motion-based saliency in the presence of ego-motion, and background subtraction in highly dynamic scenes. In all cases, the discriminant saliency detectors outperform previously proposed methods from both the saliency and the general computer vision literatures.},

	Abstract = {1. The activity of single cortical cells in area 17 of anesthetized and unanesthetized cats was recorded in response to prolonged stimulation with moving stimuli. 2. Under the appropriate conditions, all cells observed showed a progressive response decrement during the stimulation period, regardless of cell classification, i.e., simple, complex, or hypercomplex. 3. The observed response decrement was shown to be largely cortical in origin and could be adequately described with an exponential function of the form R = Rf +(R1-Rf)e-t/T. Time constants derived from such calculations yielded values ranging from 1.92 to 12.45 s under conditions of optimal-stimulation. 4. Most cells showed poststimulation effects, usually a brief period of reduced responsiveness that recovered exponentially. Recovery was essentially complete in about 5-35 s. 5. The degree to which stimuli were effective at inducing response was shown to have significant effects on the magnitude of the response decrement. 6. Several cells showed neural patterns of response and recovery that suggested the operation of intracortical inhibitory mechanisms. 7. A simple two-process model that adequately describes the behavior of all the studied cells is presented. 8. Because the properties of the cells studied correlate well with human psychophysical measures of contour and movement adaptation and recovery, a causal relationship to similar neural mechanisms in humans is suggested.},

Thus, our initial conscious percept--vision at a glance--matches a high-level, generalized, categorical scene interpretation, identifying "forest before trees." For later vision with scrutiny, reverse hierarchy routines focus attention to specific, active, low-level units, incorporating into conscious perception detailed information available there. Reverse Hierarchy Theory dissociates between early explicit perception and implicit low-level vision, explaining a variety of phenomena. Feature search "pop-out" is attributed to high areas, where large receptive fields underlie spread attention detecting categorical differences. Search for conjunctions or fine discriminations depends on reentry to low-level specific receptive fields using serial focused attention, consistent with recently reported primary visual cortex effects.},

	Abstract = {An unresolved question is how much information can be remembered from visual scenes when they are inspected by saccadic eye movements. Subjects used saccadic eye movements to scan a computer-generated scene, and afterwards, recalled as many objects as they could. Scene memory was quite good: it improved with display duration, it persisted over time long after the display was removed, and it continued to accumulate with additional viewings of the same display (Melcher, D. (2001) The persistance of memory for scenes. Nature 412, 401). The occurrence of saccadic eye movements was important to ensure good recall performance, even though subjects often recalled non-fixated objects. Inter-saccadic intervals increased with display duration, showing an influence of duration on global scanning strategy. The choice of saccadic target was predicted by a Random Selection with Distance Weighting (RSDW) model, in which the target for each saccade is selected at random from all available objects, weighted according to distance from fixation, regardless of which objects had previously been fixated. The results show that the visual memory that was reflected in the recall reports was not utilized for the immediate decision about where to look in the scene. Visual memory can be excellent, but it is not always reflected in oculomotor measures, perhaps because the cost of rapid on-line memory retrieval is too great.},

	Abstract = {The prevailing hierarchical model of sensory processing in the brain holds that different modalities of sensory information emanating from a single object are analyzed extensively during passage through their respective unisensory processing streams before they are combined in higher-order 'multisensory' regions of the cortex. Because of this view, multisensory interactions that have been found at early, putatively 'unisensory' cortical processing stages during hemodynamic imaging studies have been assumed to reflect feedback modulations that occur subsequent to multisensory processing in the higher-order multisensory areas. In this paper, we consider findings that challenge an exclusively feedback interpretation of early multisensory integration effects. First, high-density electrical mapping studies in humans have shown that multisensory convergence and integration effects can occur so early in the time course of sensory processing that purely feedback mediation becomes extremely unlikely. Second, direct neural recordings in monkeys show that, in some cases, convergent inputs at early cortical stages have physiological profiles characteristic of feedforward rather than feedback inputs. Third, damage to higher-order integrative regions in humans often spares the ability to integrate across sensory modalities. Finally, recent anatomic tracer studies have reported direct anatomical connections between primary visual and auditory cortex. These findings make it clear that multisensory convergence at early stages of cortical processing results from feedforward as well as feedback and lateral connections, thus using the full range of anatomical connections available in brain circuitry.},

	Abstract = {We compare fMRI-BOLD responses in anesthetized cats with local field potentials (LFPs), aggregate high-frequency responses (analog-Mua) and spiking activity recorded in primary and higher visual cortex of alert animals. The similarity of the activations in these electrophysiological signals to those in the BOLD is quantified by counting recording sites where different stimuli elicit the same relative activation as in the imaging experiments. Using artificial stimuli, a comparison of BOLD and LFP strongly depends on the frequency range used. Stimulating with complex or natural stimuli reduces this frequency dependence and yields a good match of LFP and BOLD. In general, this match is best between 20 and 50 Hz. The measures of high-frequency activity behave qualitatively different: the responses of the analog-Mua match those of the LFP; the spiking activity shows a low concordance with the BOLD signal. This dissociation of BOLD and spiking activity is most prominent upon stimulation with natural stimuli.},

Recent physiological studies in the primary visual cortex provide a successful account of the mechanisms by which single neurons are able to signal disparity. This work also reveals that additional processing is required to make explicit the types of signal required for depth perception (such as the ability to match features correctly between the two monocular images). Some of these signals, such as those encoding relative disparity, are found in extrastriate cortex. Several other lines of evidence also suggest that the link between perception and neuronal activity is stronger in extrastriate cortex (especially MT) than in the primary visual cortex.},

@article{cohen2009a,
	Abstract = {The sensitivity of a population of neurons, and therefore the amount of sensory information available to an animal, is limited by the sensitivity of single neurons in the population and by noise correlation between neurons. For decades, therefore, neurophysiologists have devised increasingly clever and rigorous ways to measure these critical variables (Parker and Newsome, 1998). Previous studies examining the relationship between the responses of single middle temporal (MT) neurons and direction-discrimination performance uncovered an apparent paradox. Sensitivity measurements from single neurons suggested that small numbers of neurons may account for a monkey's psychophysical performance (Britten et al., 1992), but trial-to-trial variability in activity of single MT neurons are only weakly correlated with the monkey's behavior, suggesting that the monkey's decision must be based on the responses of many neurons (Britten et al., 1996). We suggest that the resolution to this paradox lies (1) in the long stimulus duration used in the original studies, which led to an overestimate of neural sensitivity relative to psychophysical sensitivity, and (2) mistaken assumptions (because no data were available) about the level of noise correlation in MT columns with opposite preferred directions. We therefore made new physiological and psychophysical measurements in a reaction time version of the direction-discrimination task that matches neural measurements to the actual decision time of the animals. These new data, considered together with our recent data on noise correlation in MT (Cohen and Newsome, 2008), provide a substantially improved account of psychometric performance in the direction-discrimination task.},

	Abstract = {We used hue cancellation and focal naming to compare individual differences in stimuli selected for unique hues (e.g., pure blue or green) and binary hues (e.g., blue-green). Standard models assume that binary hues depend on the component responses of red-green and blue-yellow processes. However, variance was comparable for unique and binary hues, and settings across categories showed little correlation. Thus, the choices for the binary mixtures are poorly predicted by the unique hue settings. Hue scaling was used to compare individual differences both within and between categories. Ratings for distant stimuli were again independent, while neighboring stimuli covaried and revealed clusters near the poles of the LvsM and SvsLM cardinal axes. While individual differences were large, mean focal choices for red, blue-green, yellow-green, and (to a lesser extent) purple fall near the cardinal axes, such that the cardinal axes roughly delineate the boundaries for blue vs. green and yellow vs. green categories. This suggests a weak tie between the cone-opponent axes and the structure of color appearance.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Integrating information from the different senses markedly enhances the detection and identification of external stimuli. Compared with unimodal inputs, semantically and/or spatially congruent multisensory cues speed discrimination and improve reaction times. Discordant inputs have the opposite effect, reducing performance and slowing responses. These behavioural features of crossmodal processing appear to have parallels in the response properties of multisensory cells in the superior colliculi and cerebral cortex of non-human mammals. Although spatially concordant multisensory inputs can produce a dramatic, often multiplicative, increase in cellular activity, spatially disparate cues tend to induce a profound response depression. RESULTS: Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we investigated whether similar indices of crossmodal integration are detectable in human cerebral cortex, and for the synthesis of complex inputs relating to stimulus identity. Ten human subjects were exposed to varying epochs of semantically congruent and incongruent audio-visual speech and to each modality in isolation. Brain activations to matched and mismatched audio-visual inputs were contrasted with the combined response to both unimodal conditions. This strategy identified an area of heteromodal cortex in the left superior temporal sulcus that exhibited significant supra-additive response enhancement to matched audio-visual inputs and a corresponding sub-additive response to mismatched inputs. CONCLUSIONS: The data provide fMRI evidence of crossmodal binding by convergence in the human heteromodal cortex. They further suggest that response enhancement and depression may be a general property of multisensory integration operating at different levels of the neuroaxis and irrespective of the purpose for which sensory inputs are combined.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate the incidence of hyperthyroidism in Stockholm County, in those patients who were diagnosed with hyperthyroidism for the first time during the years 2003-2005. DESIGN: All new cases of hyperthyroidism > or = 18 years of age were prospectively registered to calculate the total incidence of hyperthyroidism, as well as the incidence of the subgroups: Graves' disease (GD), toxic multinodular goitre and solitary toxic adenoma (STA). Eight specialized units/hospitals in Stockholm County participated in the registration. The participating physicians were all specialists in medical endocrinology, oncology, nuclear medicine or surgery. RESULTS: During a 3-year period, 1431 new patients of hyperthyroidism were diagnosed in a well-defined adult population (> 18 years of age) of in average 1,457,036 inhabitants. This corresponds to a mean annual incidence of hyperthyroidism of 32.7/100,000. The incidence of GD was 24.5/100,000 per year, toxic nodular goitre was 3.3/100,000 per year and STA was 4.9/100,000 per year. CONCLUSIONS: The total incidence of hyperthyroidism in Stockholm County was found to be 32.7/100,000 per year, of which 75% had GD. There were a higher percentage of smokers among the patients with hyperthyroidism compared with the overall population in Stockholm, but no difference in the frequency of smoking between patients with GD and toxic nodular goitre.},

	Abstract = {Object perception depends on shape processing in the ventral visual pathway, which in monkeys culminates in inferotemporal cortex (IT). Here we provide a description of fundamental quantitative principles governing neural selectivity for complex shape in IT. By measuring responses to large, parametric sets of two-dimensional (2D) silhouette shapes, we found that neurons in posterior IT (Brodmann's areas TEO and posterior TE) integrate information about multiple contour elements (straight and curved edge fragments of the type represented in lower-level areas) using both linear and nonlinear mechanisms. This results in complex, distributed response patterns that cannot be characterized solely in terms of example stimuli. We explained these response patterns with tuning functions in multidimensional shape space and accurately predicted neural responses to the widely varying shapes in our stimulus set. Integration of contour element information in earlier stages of IT represents an important step in the transformation from low-level shape signals to complex object representation.},

	Abstract = {One of the goals of perception is to learn to respond to coherence across space, time and modality. Here we present an abstract framework for the local online unsupervised learning of this coherent information using multi-stream neural networks. The processing units distinguish between feedforward inputs projected from the environment and the lateral, contextual inputs projected from the processing units of other streams. The contextual inputs are used to guide learning towards coherent cross-stream structure. The goal of all the learning algorithms described is to maximize the predictability between each unit output and its context. Many local cost functions may be applied: e.g. mutual information, relative entropy, squared error and covariance. Theoretical and simulation results indicate that, of these, the covariance rule (1) is the only rule that specifically links and learns only those streams with coherent information, (2) can be robustly approximated by a Hebbian rule, (3) is stable with input noise, no pairwise input correlations, and in the discovery of locally less informative components that are coherent globally. In accordance with the parallel nature of the biological substrate, we also show that all the rules scale up with the number of streams.},

	Abstract = {Hyperthyroidism is a pathological syndrome in which tissue is exposed to excessive amounts of circulating thyroid hormone. The most common cause of this syndrome is Graves' disease, followed by toxic multinodular goitre, and solitary hyperfunctioning nodules. Autoimmune postpartum and subacute thyroiditis, tumours that secrete thyrotropin, and drug-induced thyroid dysfunction, are also important causes. The diagnosis of hyperthyroidism is generally straightforward, with raised serum thyroid hormones and suppressed serum thyrotropin in almost all cases. Appropriate treatment of hyperthyroidism relies on identification of the underlying cause. Antithyroid drugs, radioactive iodine, and surgery are the traditional treatments for the three common forms of hyperthyroidism. Beta-adrenergic blocking agents are used in most patients for symptomatic relief, and might be the only treatment needed for thyroiditis, which is transient. The more unusual causes of hyperthyroidism, including struma ovarii, thyrotropin-secreting tumours, choriocarcinoma, and amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis are, more often than not, a challenge to diagnose and treat.},

	Abstract = {The influential "premotor theory of attention" proposes that developing oculomotor commands mediate covert visual spatial attention. A likely source of this attentional bias is the frontal eye field (FEF), an area of the frontal cortex involved in converting visual information into saccade commands. We investigated the link between FEF activity and covert spatial attention by recording from FEF visual and saccade-related neurons in monkeys performing covert visual search tasks without eye movements. Here we show that the source of attention signals in the FEF is enhanced activity of visually responsive neurons. At the time attention is allocated to the visual search target, nonvisually responsive saccade-related movement neurons are inhibited. Therefore, in the FEF, spatial attention signals are independent of explicit saccade command signals. We propose that spatially selective activity in FEF visually responsive neurons corresponds to the mental spotlight of attention via modulation of ongoing visual processing.},

	Abstract = {It has been suggested that saliency mechanisms play a role in perceptual organization. This work evaluates the plausibility of a recently proposed generic principle for visual saliency: that all saliency decisions are optimal in a decision-theoretic sense. The discriminant saliency hypothesis is combined with the classical assumption that bottom-up saliency is a center-surround process to derive a (decision-theoretic) optimal saliency architecture. Under this architecture, the saliency of each image location is equated to the discriminant power of a set of features with respect to the classification problem that opposes stimuli at center and surround. The optimal saliency detector is derived for various stimulus modalities, including intensity, color, orientation, and motion, and shown to make accurate quantitative predictions of various psychophysics of human saliency for both static and motion stimuli. These include some classical nonlinearities of orientation and motion saliency and a Weber law that governs various types of saliency asymmetries. The discriminant saliency detectors are also applied to various saliency problems of interest in computer vision, including the prediction of human eye fixations on natural scenes, motion-based saliency in the presence of ego-motion, and background subtraction in highly dynamic scenes. In all cases, the discriminant saliency detectors outperform previously proposed methods from both the saliency and the general computer vision literatures.},

	Abstract = {Cat visual cortex contains a topographic map of visual space, plus superimposed, spatially periodic maps of ocular dominance, spatial frequency and orientation. It is hypothesized that the layout of these maps is determined by two constraints: continuity or smooth mapping of stimulus properties across the cortical surface, and coverage uniformity or uniform representation of combinations of map features over visual space. Here we use a quantitative measure of coverage uniformity (c') to test the hypothesis that cortical maps are optimized for coverage. When we perturbed the spatial relationships between ocular dominance, spatial frequency and orientation maps obtained in single regions of cortex, we found that cortical maps are at a local minimum for c'. This suggests that coverage optimization is an important organizing principle governing cortical map development.},

@article{filippo2006a,
	Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to examine characteristics of eye gaze behavior, specifically eye fixations, during reception of simultaneous communication (SC). SC was defined as conceptually accurate and semantically based signs and fingerspelling used in conjunction with speech. Specific areas of focus were (1) the pattern of frequency, duration, and location of observers' eye fixations in relation to the critical source of disambiguating information (signs or speech) in SC, and (2) how the pattern of an observer's eye fixations was related to the source of critical information (sign or speech), expectations regarding the location of the critical information after exposure to the stimulus set, observer characteristics, and sender. DESIGN: The investigation used eye tracking technology to monitor eye fixations of observers who watched silent video clips of sentences rendered in SC by three senders. Each sentence contained one of a pair of sign-critical (e.g., "sleeves"/"leaves") or speech-critical (e.g., "invited"/"hired") contrast items designed to depend on information at the hands or mouth, respectively, to resolve its ambiguity. Observers were 20 adults: five faculty/staff with early onset deafness, five faculty/staff with normal hearing, and ten college students with early onset deafness. Faculty and staff were identified by a sign language assessment specialist to be experienced and skillful users of SC. Students, exposed to SC in classroom instruction, were recruited through paper and electronic ads. RESULTS: Generally, observers looked toward the face, regardless of whether signs or speech disambiguated the message, suggesting that eye fixations toward the hands of the sender are not necessary to apprehend essential information to accurately identify an ambiguous part of the message during SC. However, other aspects of eye behavior indicated sensitivity to type of critical contrast. In particular, fixations were shorter during sign-critical items compared to speech-critical items, even after adjusting for stimulus length. In addition, experienced, adult deaf users of SC made more, brief eye fixations than observers who had normal hearing. Finally, differences in eye fixation patterns toward different senders indicates that sender characteristics affect visual processes in SC perception. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides supportive evidence of brief, frequent eye movements by deaf perceivers over small areas of a video display during reception of visuospatial linguistic information. These movements could be used to enhance activation of brain centers responsible for processing motion, consistent with neurophysiological evidence of attentional mechanisms or visual processes unique to perception of a visual language.},

@article{delahunt2004a,
	Abstract = {The optical density of the human crystalline lens progressively increases with age, the greatest increase in the visible spectrum being at short wavelengths. This produces a gradual shift in the spectral distribution of the light reaching the retina, yet color appearance remains relatively stable across the life span, implying that the visual system adapts to compensate for changes in spectral sensitivity. We explored properties of this adaptive renormalization by measuring changes in color appearance following cataract surgery. When the lens is removed, cataract patients often report a large perceptual shift in color appearance that can last for months. This change in color appearance was quantified for four cataract patients (63-84 years) by determining the chromaticity of stimuli that appeared achromatic before surgery, and at various intervals after surgery for up to 1 year. Stimuli were presented on a calibrated CRT as 9.5-deg spots, with 3-s duration and 3-s interstimulus intervals (ISIs). Chromaticity was adjusted by the subjects in CIE L*a*b* color space with luminance fixed at 32 cd/m2, on a dark background. We also estimated the optical density of the cataractous lens by comparing absolute scotopic thresholds from 410 nm to 600 nm before and after surgery. The results demonstrated that immediately following surgery there is a large increase in the short-wave light reaching the retina, mainly below 500 nm. The achromatic settings generally showed an initial large shift in the "yellow" direction after surgery that gradually (but never fully) returned to the original achromatic point before surgery. The shifts in the achromatic point occur over a number of months and appear to occur independently of the fellow eye.},

	Abstract = {Images of the same physical dimensions on the retina can appear to represent different-sized objects. One reason for this is that the human visual system can take viewing distance into account when judging apparent size. Sequentially presented images can also prompt spatial coding interactions. Here we show, using a spatial coding phenomenon (the tilt aftereffect) in tandem with viewing distance cues, that the tuning of such interactions is not simply determined by the physical dimensions of retinal input. Rather, we find that they are contingent on apparent size. Our data therefore reveal that spatial coding interactions in human vision are modulated by processes involved in the determination of apparent size.},

	Abstract = {Eye movements were recorded during the display of two images of a real-world scene that were inspected to determine whether they were the same or not (a comparative visual search task). In the displays where the pictures were different, one object had been changed, and this object was sometimes taken from another scene and was incongruent with the gist. The experiment established that incongruous objects attract eye fixations earlier than the congruous counterparts, but that this effect is not apparent until the picture has been displayed for several seconds. By controlling the visual saliency of the objects the experiment eliminates the possibility that the incongruency effect is dependent upon the conspicuity of the changed objects. A model of scene perception is suggested whereby attention is unnecessary for the partial recognition of an object that delivers sufficient information about its visual characteristics for the viewer to know that the object is improbable in that particular scene, and in which full identification requires foveal inspection.},

	Abstract = {We propose a method that allows for a rigorous statistical analysis of neural responses to natural stimuli that are nongaussian and exhibit strong correlations. We have in mind a model in which neurons are selective for a small number of stimulus dimensions out of a high-dimensional stimulus space, but within this subspace the responses can be arbitrarily nonlinear. Existing analysis methods are based on correlation functions between stimuli and responses, but these methods are guaranteed to work only in the case of gaussian stimulus ensembles. As an alternative to correlation functions, we maximize the mutual information between the neural responses and projections of the stimulus onto low-dimensional subspaces. The procedure can be done iteratively by increasing the dimensionality of this subspace. Those dimensions that allow the recovery of all of the information between spikes and the full unprojected stimuli describe the relevant subspace. If the dimensionality of the relevant subspace indeed is small, it becomes feasible to map the neuron's input-output function even under fully natural stimulus conditions. These ideas are illustrated in simulations on model visual and auditory neurons responding to natural scenes and sounds, respectively.},

	Abstract = {Rhesus monkeys are widely used as animal models of human attention. Such research rests upon the assumption that similar mechanisms underlie attention in both species. Here, we directly compare the influence of low-level stimulus features on overt attention in monkeys and humans under natural conditions. We recorded eye-movements in humans and rhesus monkeys during free-viewing of natural images. We find that intrinsic low-level features, such luminance-contrast, texture-contrast and saliency-as predicted by a standard model, are elevated at fixation points in the majority of images. These correlative effects are not significantly different between species. However, local image modifications affect both species differently: moderate modifications, which are in the range of natural fluctuations, attract overt attention in monkeys significantly stronger than they do in humans. In addition, humans show a higher inter-individual consistency regarding which locations they fixate than monkeys, in spite of the similarity for intrinsic low-level features. Taken together, these data demonstrate that-under natural conditions-low-level stimulus features affect attention in monkeys and humans differently.},

	Abstract = {Recent research suggests that human symmetry-detection mechanisms cannot simultaneously compare different colors across the axis of symmetry (Nature 399 (1999) 115). In the present study, observers were required to judge symmetry in arrays composed of elements varying not only in color, but also in size, spatial frequency and orientation. In every case, response times increased with the number of different levels of a given feature. It is proposed that this increase reflects a sequential strategy whereby coarse "binary maps" are created by attentional filtering, and the symmetry of each map is then checked. Experiment 2 required observers to detect "pseudo-symmetry" (symmetry in feature values defined relative to an arbitrary featural boundary); the ease with which this task was accomplished supported the binary map hypothesis. The results suggest that (1) symmetry detection is spatially imprecise, and (2) attentional gating can operate prior to symmetry detection in the visual pathway.},

	Abstract = {We examined the frame of reference of auditory responses in the inferior colliculus in monkeys fixating visual stimuli at different locations. Eye position modulated the level of auditory responses in 33% of the neurons we encountered, but it did not appear to shift their spatial tuning. The effect of eye position on auditory responses was substantial-comparable in magnitude to that of sound location. The eye position signal appeared to interact with the auditory responses in at least a partly multiplicative fashion. We conclude that the representation of sound location in primate IC is distributed and that the frame of reference is intermediate between head- and eye-centered coordinates. The information contained in these neurons appears to be sufficient for later neural stages to calculate the positions of sounds with respect to the eyes.},

@article{mishra2007a,
	Abstract = {When a single flash of light is presented interposed between two brief auditory stimuli separated by 60-100 ms, subjects typically report perceiving two flashes (Shams et al., 2000, 2002). We investigated the timing and localization of the cortical processes that underlie this illusory flash effect in 34 subjects by means of 64-channel recordings of event-related potentials (ERPs). A difference ERP calculated to isolate neural activity associated with the illusory second flash revealed an early modulation of visual cortex activity at 30-60 ms after the second sound, which was larger in amplitude in subjects who saw the illusory flash more frequently. These subjects also showed this early modulation in response to other combinations of auditory and visual stimuli, thus pointing to consistent individual differences in the neural connectivity that underlies cross-modal integration. The overall pattern of cortical activity associated with the cross-modally induced illusory flash, however, differed markedly from that evoked by a real second flash. A trial-by-trial analysis showed that short-latency ERP activity localized to auditory cortex and polymodal cortex of the temporal lobe, concurrent with gamma bursts in visual cortex, were associated with perception of the double-flash illusion. These results provide evidence that perception of the illusory second flash is based on a very rapid dynamic interplay between auditory and visual cortical areas that is triggered by the second sound.},

(1982) Science 215, 1532-1534] have recently observed that an injection of horseradish peroxidase into the striate cortex of the tree shrew produces a patchy distribution of label adjacent to the injection site. They proposed that this pattern might be due to populations of neurons with long-range cortico-cortical connections that are interspersed with populations having no such connections. We suggest here an alternative explanation. We can account for the pattern by supposing that the label is carrier by a system of oriented axons. We suppose that these axons link cells with similar orientation preferences and make their connections within a narrow strip of cortex whose direction is related to the orientation of the cells in question. We suggest that such connections could be involved in generating complex receptive fields from simple ones. Other possibilities are that they are used to generate very elongated receptive fields, inhibitory flanks, or end-stopping. We suggest a number of experimental tests of these ideas.},

@article{nodari2008a,
	Abstract = {Among mice, pheromones and other social odor cues convey information about sex, social status, and identity; however, the molecular nature of these cues is essentially unknown. To identify these cues, we screened chromatographic fractions of female mouse urine for their ability to cause reproducible firing rate increases in the pheromone-detecting vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSNs) using multielectrode array (MEA) recording. Active compounds were found to be remarkably homogenous in their basic properties, with most being of low molecular weight, moderate hydrophobicity, low volatility, and possessing a negative electric charge. Purification and structural analysis of active compounds revealed multiple sulfated steroids, of which two were identified as sulfated glucocorticoids, including corticosterone 21-sulfate. Sulfatase-treated urine extracts lost >80% of their activity, indicating that sulfated compounds are the predominant VSN ligands in female mouse urine. As measured by MEA recording, a collection of 31 synthetic sulfated steroids triggered responses 30-fold more frequently than did a similarly sized stimulus set containing the majority of all previously reported VSN ligands. Collectively, VSNs detected all major classes of sulfated steroids, but individual neurons were sensitive to small variations in chemical structure. VSNs from both males and females detected sulfated steroids, but knock-outs for the sensory transduction channel TRPC2 did not detect these compounds. Urine concentrations of the two sulfated glucocorticoids increased many fold in stressed animals, indicating that information about physiological status is encoded by the urine concentration of particular sulfated steroids. These results provide an unprecedented characterization of the signals available for chemical communication among mice.},

	Abstract = {The brain is capable of integrating motion information arising from visual and auditory input. Such integration between sensory modalities can aid one another and helps to stabilize the motion percept. However, if motion information differs between sensory modalities, it can also result in an illusory auditory motion percept. This phenomenon is referred to as the cross-modal dynamic capture (CDC) illusion. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate whether early visual and auditory motion areas are involved in the generation of this illusion. Among the trials containing conflicting audiovisual motion, we compared the trials in which CDC occurred to those in which it did not and used a region of interest approach to see whether the auditory motion complex (AMC) and the visual motion area hMT/V5+ were affected by this illusion. Our results show that CDC reduces activation in bilateral auditory motion areas while increasing activity in the bilateral hMT/V5+. Interestingly, our data show that the CDC illusion is preceded by an enhanced activation that is most dominantly present in the ventral intraparietal sulcus. Moreover, we assessed the effect of motion coherency, which was found to enhance activation in bilateral hMT/V5+ as well as in an area adjacent to the right AMC. Together, our results show that audiovisual integration occurs in early motion areas. Furthermore, it seems that the cognitive state of subjects before stimulus onset plays an important role in the generation of multisensory illusions.},

Whereas a recent study challenged this view in suggesting that a single sniff was sufficient for optimal olfactory discrimination, a study by Abraham et al. in this issue of Neuron sets out to negate the challenge by demonstrating increased processing time for discrimination of similar versus dissimilar stimuli. Here we reconcile both studies, which in our view together support the notion of a speed-accuracy tradeoff in olfactory discriminations that are made within about 200 ms. These findings are discussed in light of the challenges related to defining olfactory perceptual similarity in nonhuman animals.},

	Abstract = {Horizontal connections, formed primarily by the axon collaterals of pyramidal neurons in layer 2/3 of visual cortex, extend for millimeters parallel to the cortical surface and form patchy terminations. Previous studies have provided evidence that the patches formed by horizontal connections exhibit modular specificity, preferentially linking columns of neurons with similar response characteristics, such as preferred orientation. The issue of how these connections are distributed with respect to the topographic map of visual space, however, has not been resolved. Here we combine optical imaging of intrinsic signals with small extracellular injections of biocytin to assess quantitatively the specificity of horizontal connections with respect to both the map of orientation preference and the map of visual space in tree shrew V1. Our results indicate that horizontal connections outside a radius of 500 microm from the injection site exhibit not only modular specificity, but also specificity for axis of projection. Labeled axons extend for longer distances, and give off more terminal boutons, along an axis in the map of visual space that corresponds to the preferred orientation of the injection site. Inside of 500 microm, the pattern of connections is much less specific, with boutons found along every axis, contacting sites with a wide range of preferred orientations. The system of long-range horizontal connections can be summarized as preferentially linking neurons with co-oriented, co-axially aligned receptive fields. These observations suggest specific ways that horizontal circuits contribute to the response properties of layer 2/3 neurons and to mechanisms of visual perception.},

	Abstract = {We investigated the influences of different types of temporal correlations in the input signal on the functions and coding properties of neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1). We found that the temporal transfer functions of V1 neurons exhibit higher gain, and the spike responses exhibit higher coding efficiency and information transmission rates, for the 1/f (natural long-term correlation) signals than for 1/f(0) (no correlation) and 1/f(2) (stronger long-term correlation) signals. These results suggest that the intermediate long-term correlation ubiquitous to natural signals may play an important role in shaping and optimizing the machinery of neurons in their adaptation to the natural environment.},

	Abstract = {The visual environment is perceived as an organized whole of objects and their surroundings. In many visual cortical areas, however, neurons are typically activated when a stimulus is presented over a very limited portion of the visual field, the receptive field of that neuron. To bridge the gap between this piecewise neuronal analysis and our global visual percepts, it has been postulated that neurons representing elements of the same object fire in synchrony to represent the perceptual organization of a scene. Experiments with stimuli such as moving bars or gratings have provided evidence for this hypothesis. We have further tested this by presenting monkeys with various textured scenes consisting of a figure on a background, and recorded neuronal activity in the primary visual cortex (area V1). Our results show no systematic relationship between the synchrony of firing of pairs of neurons and the perceptual organization of the scene. Instead, pairs of recording sites representing elements of the same figure most commonly showed equal amounts of synchrony between them as did pairs of which one site represented the figure and the other the background. We conclude that synchrony in V1 does not reflect the binding of features that leads to texture segregation.},

	Abstract = {Sensory information about the outside world is encoded by neurons in sequences of discrete, identical pulses termed action potentials or spikes. There is persistent controversy about the extent to which the precise timing of these spikes is relevant to the function of the brain. We revisit this issue, using the motion-sensitive neurons of the fly visual system as a test case. Our experimental methods allow us to deliver more nearly natural visual stimuli, comparable to those which flies encounter in free, acrobatic flight. New mathematical methods allow us to draw more reliable conclusions about the information content of neural responses even when the set of possible responses is very large. We find that significant amounts of visual information are represented by details of the spike train at millisecond and sub-millisecond precision, even though the sensory input has a correlation time of approximately 55 ms; different patterns of spike timing represent distinct motion trajectories, and the absolute timing of spikes points to particular features of these trajectories with high precision. Finally, the efficiency of our entropy estimator makes it possible to uncover features of neural coding relevant for natural visual stimuli: first, the system's information transmission rate varies with natural fluctuations in light intensity, resulting from varying cloud cover, such that marginal increases in information rate thus occur even when the individual photoreceptors are counting on the order of one million photons per second. Secondly, we see that the system exploits the relatively slow dynamics of the stimulus to remove coding redundancy and so generate a more efficient neural code.},

@article{laaris2000a,
	Abstract = {We used optical imaging of voltage-sensitive dye signals to study the spatiotemporal spread of activity in the mouse barrel cortex, evoked by stimulation of thalamocortical afferents in an in vitro slice preparation. Stimulation of the thalamus, at low current intensity, results in activity largely restricted to a single barrel, and to the border between layers Vb and VI. Low concentrations of the GABA(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline increase the amplitude of the optical signals, without affecting their spatiotemporal propagation. Higher concentrations of bicuculline result in paroxysmal activity, which propagates via intracolumnar and intercolumnar excitatory pathways. Enhancing the activity of NMDA receptors, by removing Mg(2+) from the extracellular solution, dramatically alters the spatiotemporal pattern of excitation: activity spreads to supragranular and infragranular layers and adjacent barrel columns. This enhanced propagation is suppressed by the NMDA receptor antagonist AP5. A similar enhancement of activity propagation can be produced by stimulating the thalamus with a short, high-frequency pulse train. Application of AP5 suppresses the frequency-dependent spread of activity. These findings indicate that the spatiotemporal spread of activity in the barrel cortex is altered by varying the temporal patterns of thalamic inputs, via an NMDA receptor-mediated mechanism, and suggest that a similar process occurs during repetitive whisking activity.},

	Abstract = {A 33-year old female was diagnosed as Graves' disease and started on carbimazole. One month later when she was already euthyroid only on carbimazole therapy, she developed acute pancreatitis associated with mild cholestatic hepatitis and erythema nodosum. Carbimazole therapy was interrupted, pancreatic and liver function gradually improved and became normalized two weeks later. Other potential etiological causes of acute pancreatitis, hepatitis and erythema nodosum were excluded. Rechallenge with a single dose of carbimazole led to a new episode of acute pancreatitis and cholestatic hepatitis one day later. The appearance of different hypersensitivity reactions including pancreatitis, hepatitis and erythema nodosum, together with the observation that the interval between drug intake and onset of symptoms became shorter with repeated exposure to carbimazole, point to an immune-mediated mechanism. Carbimazole has to be added to the list of drugs capable of inducing acute pancreatitis, and should be emphasized the need to discontinue this medication as soon as there is evidence of pancreatic dysfunction.},

	Abstract = {To find a target object in a crowded scene, a face in a crowd for example, the visual system might turn the neural representation of each object on and off in a serial fashion, testing each representation against a template of the target item. Alternatively, it might allow the processing of all objects in parallel but bias activity in favor of those neurons that represent critical features of the target, until the target emerges from the background. To test these possibilities, we recorded neurons in area V4 of monkeys freely scanning a complex array to find a target defined by color, shape, or both. Throughout the period of searching, neurons gave enhanced responses and synchronized their activity in the gamma range whenever a preferred stimulus in their receptive field matched a feature of the target, as predicted by parallel models. Neurons also gave enhanced responses to candidate targets that were selected for saccades, or foveation, reflecting a serial component of visual search. Thus, serial and parallel mechanisms of response enhancement and neural synchrony work together to identify objects in a scene.

	Abstract = {Whether general principles can explain the layouts of cortical maps remains unresolved. In primary visual cortex of ferret, the relationships between the maps of visual space and response features are predicted by a "dimension-reduction" model. The representation of visual space is anisotropic, with the elevation and azimuth axes having different magnification. This anisotropy is reflected in the orientation, ocular dominance, and spatial frequency domains, which are elongated such that their directions of rapid change, or high-gradient axes, are orthogonal to the high-gradient axis of the visual map. The feature maps are also strongly interdependent-their high-gradient regions avoid one another and intersect orthogonally where essential, so that overlap is minimized. Our results demonstrate a clear influence of the visual map on each feature map. In turn, the local representation of visual space is smooth, as predicted when many features are mapped within a cortical area.},

@article{nevian2007a,
	Abstract = {Basal dendrites receive the majority of synapses that contact neocortical pyramidal neurons, yet our knowledge of synaptic processing in these dendrites has been hampered by their inaccessibility for electrical recordings. A new approach to patch-clamp recordings enabled us to characterize the integrative properties of these cells. Despite the short physical length of rat basal dendrites, synaptic inputs were electrotonically remote from the soma (>30-fold excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) attenuation) and back-propagating action potentials were significantly attenuated. Unitary EPSPs were location dependent, reaching large amplitudes distally (>8 mV), yet their somatic contribution was relatively location independent. Basal dendrites support sodium and NMDA spikes, but not calcium spikes, for 75% of their length. This suggests that basal dendrites, despite their proximity to the site of action potential initiation, do not form a single basal-somatic region but rather should be considered as a separate integrative compartment favoring two integration modes: subthreshold, location-independent summation versus local amplification of incoming spatiotemporally clustered information.},

@article{ghazanfar2005a,
	Abstract = {In the social world, multiple sensory channels are used concurrently to facilitate communication. Among human and nonhuman primates, faces and voices are the primary means of transmitting social signals (Adolphs, 2003; Ghazanfar and Santos, 2004). Primates recognize the correspondence between species-specific facial and vocal expressions (Massaro, 1998; Ghazanfar and Logothetis, 2003; Izumi and Kojima, 2004), and these visual and auditory channels can be integrated into unified percepts to enhance detection and discrimination. Where and how such communication signals are integrated at the neural level are poorly understood. In particular, it is unclear what role "unimodal" sensory areas, such as the auditory cortex, may play. We recorded local field potential activity, the signal that best correlates with human imaging and event-related potential signals, in both the core and lateral belt regions of the auditory cortex in awake behaving rhesus monkeys while they viewed vocalizing conspecifics. We demonstrate unequivocally that the primate auditory cortex integrates facial and vocal signals through enhancement and suppression of field potentials in both the core and lateral belt regions. The majority of these multisensory responses were specific to face/voice integration, and the lateral belt region shows a greater frequency of multisensory integration than the core region. These multisensory processes in the auditory cortex likely occur via reciprocal interactions with the superior temporal sulcus.},

Their receptive fields were consistent with previous single-unit studies. Their axonal arbors were less elaborate than in equivalent neurons in the cat, but the laminar specificity of the boutons was very much more precise in the monkey than in the cat. Nevertheless, the basic cortical circuits in cat and monkey appear to be very similar.},

	Abstract = {The eye movements made by viewers of natural images often feature a predominance of horizontal saccades. Can this behaviour be explained by the distribution of saliency around the horizon, low-level oculomotor factors, top-down control or laboratory artefacts? Two experiments explored this bias by recording saccades whilst subjects viewed photographs rotated to varying extents, but within a constant square frame. The findings show that the dominant saccade direction follows the orientation of the scene, though this pattern varies in interiors and during recognition of previously seen pictures. This demonstrates that a horizon bias is robust and affected by both the distribution of features and more global representations of the scene layout.},

	Abstract = {Models of low-level saliency predict that when we first look at a photograph our first few eye movements should be made towards visually conspicuous objects. Two experiments investigated this prediction by recording eye fixations while viewers inspected pictures of room interiors that contained objects with known saliency characteristics. Highly salient objects did attract fixations earlier than less conspicuous objects, but only in a task requiring general encoding of the whole picture. When participants were required to detect the presence of a small target, then the visual saliency of nontarget objects did not influence fixations. These results support modifications of the model that take the cognitive override of saliency into account by allowing task demands to reduce the saliency weights of task-irrelevant objects.The pictures sometimes contained incongruent objects that were taken from other rooms. These objects were used to test the hypothesis that previous reports of the early fixation of congruent objects have not been consistent because the effect depends upon the visual conspicuity of the incongruent object. There was an effect of incongruency in both experiments, with earlier fixation of objects that violated the gist of the scene, but the effect was only apparent for inconspicuous objects, which argues against the hypothesis.},

	Abstract = {Summary The organization of primary visual cortex (V1) into functional maps makes individual cells operate in a variety of contexts. For instance, some neurons lie in regions of fairly homogeneous orientation preference (iso-orientation domains), while others lie in regions with a variety of preferences (e.g., pinwheel centers). We asked whether this diversity in local map structure correlates with the degree of selectivity of spike responses. We used a combination of imaging and electrophysiology to reveal that neurons in regions of homogeneous orientation preference have much sharper tuning. Moreover, in both monkeys and cats, a common principle links the structure of the orientation map, on the spatial scale of dendritic integration, to the degree of selectivity of individual cells. We conclude that neural computation is not invariant across the cortical surface. This finding must factor into future theories of receptive field wiring and map development.},
	Annote = {Excellent paper... Shows how functional differences of the neurons such as width of the tuning curves, is dependent on the position of the neuron on the cortical map. More a neuron is located in a region of functional homogeniety, more it has sharp tuning. For example a neuron within proximity of a pinwheel has very broad tuning curve. Moreover these results explains also another fact known since long time. Cats have sharper tuning curves than monkeys. Indeed the orientation maps of cats have more functionaly homogenous areas than monkeys which have really fast changing orientation maps. they state that neuron body is about 30 micrometer.},

Observers received multiple exposures to newly learned faces over four consecutive days. Recall tasks were performed on all 4 days, and a recognition task was performed on the fourth day. Eye movement behavior was compared across facial exposure and task type. Overall, the eyes were viewed for longer and more often than any other facial region, regardless of face familiarity. As a face became more familiar, observers made fewer fixations during recall and recognition. With increased exposure, observers sampled more from the eyes and sampled less from the nose, mouth, forehead, chin, and cheek regions. Interestingly, this change in scanning behavior was only observed for recall tasks, but not for recognition.},

	Abstract = {To facilitate the combination of optical imaging with various electrode-based techniques, we have designed and produced a skull-mounting "sliding-top cranial window" and a removable "electrode positioner microdrive". These new devices were used to study sensory processing in chronic and acute experiments in the cerebral cortices of cats and monkeys. This assembly allows simultaneous optical imaging of intrinsic signals or voltage-sensitive dyes combined with extracellular recording (single and multiple unit recording and local field potential), intracellular recording, microstimulation, or targeted injection of tracers. After the functional architecture is determined by optical imaging, electrodes are targeted into a selected cortical site under full visual control, at a variety of penetration angles (30-90 degrees ), accessing a large cortical area. The device consists of three parts: (1) a skull-mounting chamber, (2) a sliding cap, and (3) a microdrive. The microdrive can easily be removed and the cranial window is then sealed and covered with a flat protective cover. For chronic experiments, this arrangement allows the animal to be handled over a long period while fitted with a sealed cranial window of minimal volume and weight, and with negligible risk of accidental damage or infection.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study examined the scanpaths of patients with homonymous hemianopia while viewing naturalistic pictures in their original and also spatially filtered forms. Features of their scanpaths with respect to various saccade and fixation parameters were examined to determine whether they develop compensatory eye movement strategies. The effects of various lesion parameters including location, size, and age on the evolution of such strategies were considered. METHODS: Eye movements of eight patients with homonymous hemianopia (four left, four right), but lacking neglect, were recorded while they viewed 22 images of real scenes, and they were compared with the eye movements of eight age matched controls. Subjects viewed each image for 3 seconds, initially in a spatially filtered form in which much of the semantic content had been removed, and then in their unfiltered, original form. RESULTS: Patients differed significantly from controls in various fixation and saccade parameters. For fixation parameters patients with hemianopia fixated different spatial positions from controls, made more fixations which were more widely distributed and of shorter duration than controls, and spent a greater proportion of their total fixation time in the area corresponding to their blind hemifield. They did not make significantly more refixations than controls. For saccade parameters patients made more saccades into their blind hemifield, these saccades having shorter latencies and shorter amplitudes than those made into their seeing field, and had longer scanpaths than control subjects. The amplitude of their first saccade was longer than that of controls although its direction did not correlate simply with the side of the field defect. Their mean saccade amplitude was similar to that of controls. Filtering out high spatial frequencies within images seemed to accentuate the described differences between eye movement characteristics of hemianopes and controls. Scanpath differences correlated with increasing age but not location or size of lesions causing the hemianopia. CONCLUSION: Various features of scanpaths produced by hemianopes were different from normal subjects. These differences correlated with lesion age and may reflect the evolution of a compensatory eye movement strategy.},

	Abstract = {The visual cortex represents stimuli through the activity of neuronal populations. We measured the evolution of this activity in space and time by imaging voltage-sensitive dyes in cat area V1. Contrast-reversing stimuli elicit responses that oscillate at twice the stimulus frequency, indicating that signals originate mostly in complex cells. These responses stand clear of the noise, whose amplitude decreases as 1/frequency, and yield high-resolution maps of orientation preference and retinotopy. We first show how these maps are combined to yield the responses to focal, oriented stimuli. We then study the evolution of the oscillating activity in space and time. In the orientation domain, it is a standing wave. In the spatial domain, it is a traveling wave propagating at 0.2-0.5 m/s. These different dynamics indicate a fundamental distinction in the circuits underlying selectivity for position and orientation, two key stimulus attributes.},

	Abstract = {Neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) are commonly classified as simple or complex based upon their sensitivity to the sign of stimulus contrast. The responses of both cell types can be described by a general model in which the outputs of a set of linear filters are nonlinearly combined. We estimated the model for a population of V1 neurons by analyzing the mean and covariance of the spatiotemporal distribution of random bar stimuli that were associated with spikes. This analysis reveals an unsuspected richness of neuronal computation within V1. Specifically, simple and complex cell responses are best described using more linear filters than the one or two found in standard models. Many filters revealed by the model contribute suppressive signals that appear to have a predominantly divisive influence on neuronal firing. Suppressive signals are especially potent in direction-selective cells, where they reduce responses to stimuli moving in the nonpreferred direction.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The long-term observation of vegetarians in affluent countries can provide insight into the relative effects of a vegetarian diet and lifestyle factors on mortality. METHODS: A cohort study of vegetarians and health-conscious persons in Germany was followed-up prospectively for 21 years, including 1,225 vegetarians and 679 health-conscious nonvegetarians. Standardized mortality ratios compared with the German general population were calculated for all causes and specific causes. Within the cohort, Poisson regression modeling was used to investigate the joint effects of several risk factors on overall and cause-specific mortality. RESULTS: Standardized mortality ratios for all-cause mortality was significantly below 100: 59 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 54-64], predominantly due to a deficit of deaths from circulatory diseases. Within the cohort, vegetarian compared with nonvegetarian diet had no effect on overall mortality [rate ratio (RR), 1.10; 95% CI, 0.89-1.36], whereas moderate and high physical activity significantly reduced risk of death (RR, 0.62, 0.64), adjusted for age, sex, smoking, alcohol intake, body mass index, and educational level. Vegetarian diet was however associated with a reduced RR of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.41-1.18) for ischemic heart disease, which could partly be related to avoidance of meat. CONCLUSIONS: Both vegetarians and nonvegetarian health-conscious persons in this study have reduced mortality compared with the general population. Within the study, low prevalence of smoking and moderate or high level of physical activity but not strictly vegetarian diet was associated with reduced overall mortality. The nonsignificant reduction in mortality from ischemic heart diseases in vegetarians compared with health-conscious persons could be explained in part by avoidance of meat intake.},

	Abstract = {We present a model for the self-organized formation of place cells, head-direction cells, and spatial-view cells in the hippocampal formation based on unsupervised learning on quasi-natural visual stimuli. The model comprises a hierarchy of Slow Feature Analysis (SFA) nodes, which were recently shown to reproduce many properties of complex cells in the early visual system []. The system extracts a distributed grid-like representation of position and orientation, which is transcoded into a localized place-field, head-direction, or view representation, by sparse coding. The type of cells that develops depends solely on the relevant input statistics, i.e., the movement pattern of the simulated animal. The numerical simulations are complemented by a mathematical analysis that allows us to accurately predict the output of the top SFA layer.},

	Abstract = {Attention regulates the flood of sensory information into a manageable stream, and so understanding how attention is controlled is central to understanding cognition. Competing theories suggest visual search involves serial and/or parallel allocation of attention, but there is little direct, neural evidence for either mechanism. Two monkeys were trained to covertly search an array for a target stimulus under visual search (endogenous) and pop-out (exogenous) conditions. Here, we present neural evidence in the frontal eye fields (FEF) for serial, covert shifts of attention during search but not pop-out. Furthermore, attention shifts reflected in FEF spiking activity were correlated with 18-34 Hz oscillations in the local field potential, suggesting a "clocking" signal. This provides direct neural evidence that primates can spontaneously adopt a serial search strategy and that these serial covert shifts of attention are directed by the FEF. It also suggests that neuron population oscillations may regulate the timing of cognitive processing.},

	Abstract = {These experiments investigated the involvement of several temporal lobe regions in consolidation of recognition memory. Anisomycin, a protein synthesis inhibitor, was infused into the hippocampus, perirhinal cortex, insular cortex, or basolateral amygdala of rats immediately after the sample phase of object or object-in-context recognition memory training. Anisomycin infused into perirhinal or insular cortices blocked long-term (24 h), but not short-term (90 min) object recognition memory. Infusions into the hippocampus or amygdala did not impair object recognition memory. Anisomycin infused into the hippocampus blocked long-term, but not short-term object-in-context recognition memory, whereas infusions administered into the perirhinal cortex, insular cortex, or amygdala did not affect object-in-context recognition memory. These results clearly indicate that distinct regions of the temporal lobe are differentially involved in long-term object and object-in-context recognition memory. Whereas perirhinal and insular cortices are required for consolidation of familiar objects, the hippocampus is necessary for consolidation of contextual information of recognition memory. Altogether, these results suggest that temporal lobe structures are differentially involved in recognition memory consolidation.},

@article{einhauser2007b,
	Abstract = {During natural behavior humans continuously adjust their gaze by moving head and eyes, yielding rich dynamics of the retinal input. Sensory coding models, however, typically assume visual input as smooth or a sequence of static images interleaved by volitional gaze shifts. Are these assumptions valid during free exploration behavior in natural environments? We used an innovative technique to simultaneously record gaze and head movements in humans, who freely explored various environments (forest, train station, apartment). Most movements occur along the cardinal axes, and the predominance of vertical or horizontal movements depends on the environment. Eye and head movements co-occur more frequently than their individual statistics predicts under an independence assumption. The majority of co-occurring movements point in opposite directions, consistent with a gaze-stabilizing role of eye movements. Nevertheless, a substantial fraction of eye movements point in the same direction as co-occurring head movements. Even under the very most conservative assumptions, saccadic eye movements alone cannot account for these synergistic movements. Hence nonsaccadic eye movements that interact synergistically with head movements to adjust gaze cannot be neglected in natural visual input. Natural retinal input is continuously dynamic, and cannot be faithfully modeled as a mere sequence of static frames with interleaved large saccades.},

	Abstract = {Centre-surround interaction in the primary visual cortex (area V1) has been studied extensively using artificial, abstract stimulus patterns, such as bars, gratings and simple texture patterns. In this experiment, we extend the study of centre-surround interaction by using natural scene images. We systematically varied the contrast of natural image surrounds presented outside the classical receptive field (CRF), and recorded neuronal response to a natural image patch presented within the CRF in area V1 of awake, fixating macaques. For the majority of neurons (67 out of 111), the natural image surrounds profoundly modulated, mainly by suppressing, neuronal responses to CRF images. These modulatory effects started at the earliest stage of neuronal responses, and often depended on the contrast and higher-order structures of the surrounds. For 47 out of 67 neurons, randomising the phases of the Fourier spectrum of the natural image surround diminished the centre-surround interaction. Our results suggest that the centre-surround interaction in area V1 can be extended to natural vision, and is sensitive to the higher-order structures of natural scene images, such as image contours.},

@article{foxe2005b,
	Abstract = {The prevailing hierarchical model of sensory processing in the brain holds that different modalities of sensory information emanating from a single object are analyzed extensively during passage through their respective unisensory processing streams before they are combined in higher-order 'multisensory' regions of the cortex. Because of this view, multisensory interactions that have been found at early, putatively 'unisensory' cortical processing stages during hemodynamic imaging studies have been assumed to reflect feedback modulations that occur subsequent to multisensory processing in the higher-order multisensory areas. In this paper, we consider findings that challenge an exclusively feedback interpretation of early multisensory integration effects. First, high-density electrical mapping studies in humans have shown that multisensory convergence and integration effects can occur so early in the time course of sensory processing that purely feedback mediation becomes extremely unlikely. Second, direct neural recordings in monkeys show that, in some cases, convergent inputs at early cortical stages have physiological profiles characteristic of feedforward rather than feedback inputs. Third, damage to higher-order integrative regions in humans often spares the ability to integrate across sensory modalities. Finally, recent anatomic tracer studies have reported direct anatomical connections between primary visual and auditory cortex. These findings make it clear that multisensory convergence at early stages of cortical processing results from feedforward as well as feedback and lateral connections, thus using the full range of anatomical connections available in brain circuitry.},

Evidence exists that a low iodine intake is associated with a high long-term remission rate for drug treatment of diffuse toxic goitre. Seventy-five patients participated with 45% of patients entering into long-term remission which has been maintained for a mean of 52.5 +/- 38.8 months. Fifty-five per cent of patients demonstrated relapse at a mean of 7.4 +/- 10.4 months following the withdrawal of thiouracil treatment. These findings were similar to those reported from countries with abundant iodine intake. The data in the present study confirms the usefulness of drug treatment for diffuse toxic goitre in an Irish population but the reported iodine deficiency does not appear to confer a particular advantage.},

	Abstract = {Visual stimulation of a region outside the receptive field of single cells in visual cortex often results in the modulation of their responses. The modulatory effects are thought to be mediated through lateral connections within visual cortex. Research on lateral interactions commonly shows suppression. There has been no systematic study of the optimal conditions for facilitation. Here we have studied the nature of the modulation using a new type of compound stimulus: contrast reversal of pattern stimuli made of three discrete grating patches. The middle patch, optimally fitted to the receptive field in orientation, size, and spatial as well as temporal frequencies, was flanked by two similar patches presented well outside the receptive field. We found that (1) both facilitation and suppression occurred often in the same cells, when orientations of the target and flankers matched the receptive-field's optimal orientation; (2) facilitation with collinear flankers occurred most frequently at target contrasts just above the cell's firing threshold and suppression prevailed at high contrasts; (3) facilitative or suppressive modulation was obtained with target-flankers separation of up to 12 deg or more; (4) collinear facilitation was lost when flankers' orientation was rotated by 90 deg, while keeping all other parameters the same; and (5) neither the modulation mode nor the proportion of modulated cells was related to the cell types (simple vs. complex cells) and cells' laminar locations. Here we have provided physiological evidence for contrast-dependent, collinear facilitation probably underlying perceptual grouping in humans.},

	Abstract = {Stimulus features such as edge orientation, motion direction and spatial frequency are thought to be encoded in the primary visual cortex by overlapping feature maps arranged so that the location of neurons activated by a particular combination of stimulus features can be predicted from the intersections of these maps. This view is based on the use of grating stimuli, which limit the range of stimulus combinations that can be examined. We used optical imaging of intrinsic signals in ferrets to assess patterns of population activity evoked by the motion of a texture (a field of iso-oriented bars). Here we show that the same neural population can be activated by multiple combinations of orientation, length, motion axis and speed. Rather than reflecting the intersection of multiple maps, our results indicate that population activity in primary visual cortex is better described as a single map of spatiotemporal energy.},

	Abstract = {Here analytical and simulation results are presented characterizing the recoding arising when overlapping patterns of sensor input impinge on an array of model neurons with branched thresholded dendritic trees. Thus, the neural units employed are intended to capture the integrative behavior of pyramidal cells that sustain isolated Na(+) or NMDA spikes in their branches. Given a defined set of sensor vectors, equations were derived for the probability of firing of both branches and neurons and for the expected overlap between the neural firing patterns triggered by two afferent patterns of given overlap. Thus, both the sparseness of the neural representation and the orthogonalization of overlapping vectors were computed. Simulations were then performed with an array of 1000 neurons comprising 30,000 branches to verify the analytical results and confirm their applicability to systems (which include any practicable artificial system) in which the combinatorically possible branches and neurons are severely subsampled. A means of readout and a measure of discrimination performance were provided so that the accuracy of discrimination among overlapping sensor vectors could be optimized as a function of neuron structure parameters. Good performance required both orthogonalization of the afferent patterns, so that discrimination was accurate and free of interference, and maintenance of a minimum level of neural activity, so that some neurons fired in response to each sensor pattern. It is shown that the discrimination performance achieved by arrays of neurons with branched dendritic trees could not be reached with single-compartment units, regardless of how many of the latter are used. The analytical results furnish a benchmark against which to measure further enhancements in the performance of subsequent simulated systems incorporating local neural mechanisms which, while often less amenable to closed-form analysis, are ubiquitous in biological neural circuitry.},

	Abstract = {Measurements were carried out of saccadic eye movements made during brief (3 s) examination of images which the observer was asked to identify. Each image was identified in three forms: low-pass filtered, high-pass filtered, and unfiltered. The analysis of the eye-movement patterns was based on the locations of fixations made during examination of the images, for which purpose a least-squares measures of similarity between two sets of locations was introduced. It is shown that there is a high degree of similarity between fixations made by the same observer to the different versions of a given image and that for a given image there is a high degree of similarity between fixations made by the eighteen observers who participated in the experiments. The similarities are greater for the initial 1.5 s than for the full viewing period of 3 s. The similarity between the locations of fixations and those of selected image features such as local contrast, high-spatial-frequency content, and edge density was also examined. It is shown that there is only weak similarity between the locations of fixations and those of any given local image feature, and the tendency of observers to fixate centrally on the image is identified as the principal reason for the low similarity values. It is shown that if the nonuniform distribution of eye movements is taken into account, significant similarities are found between the locations of fixations and those of certain image features, such as edge density.},

@article{bullier2001a,
	Abstract = {The results of a previous study {\$}[{\$}Hupe et al. (1998) Nature, 394: 784-787{\$}]{\$} led us to conclude that feedback connections are important for differentiating a figure from the background, particularly in the case of low salience stimuli. This conclusion was principally based on the observation in area V3 neurons that inactivating MT by cooling led to a severe weakening of the center response and of the center-surround interactions, and that these effects were particularly strong for low salience stimuli. In the present paper, we first show that the results extend to areas V1 and V2. In particular, the inhibitory center-surround interactions in areas V1, V2 and V3 disappear almost completely in the absence of feedback input from MT for low salience stimuli, whereas the effects are much more limited for stimuli of middle and high salience. We then compare the results obtained in studies of feedback connections from MT to those obtained in a study of the feedback action of area V2 onto V1 neurons [Hupe et al. (2001) J. Neurophysiol., 85: 146-163], in which the same effects were observed on the center mechanism (decrease in response), but no effects were seen on the center-surround interactions. We conclude that feedback connections act in a non-linear fashion to boost the gain of the center mechanism and that they combine with horizontal connections to generate the center-surround interactions.},

	Abstract = {The responses of simple cells in primary visual cortex to sinusoidal gratings can primarily be predicted from their spatial receptive fields, as mapped using spots or bars. Although this quasilinearity is well documented, it is not clear whether it holds for complex natural stimuli. We recorded from simple cells in the primary visual cortex of anesthetized ferrets while stimulating with flashed digitized photographs of natural scenes. We applied standard reverse-correlation methods to quantify the average natural stimulus that invokes a neuronal response. Although these maps cannot be the receptive fields, we find that they still predict the preferred orientation of grating for each cell very well (r = 0.91); they do not predict the spatial-frequency tuning. Using a novel application of the linear reconstruction method called regularized pseudoinverse, we were able to recover high-resolution receptive-field maps from the responses to a relatively small number of natural scenes. These receptive-field maps not only predict the optimum orientation of each cell (r = 0.96) but also the spatial-frequency optimum (r = 0.89); the maps also predict the tuning bandwidths of many cells. Therefore, our first conclusion is that the tuning preferences of the cells are primarily linear and constant across stimulus type. However, when we used these maps to predict the actual responses of the cells to natural scenes, we did find evidence of expansive output nonlinearity and nonlinear influences from outside the classical receptive fields, orientation tuning, and spatial-frequency tuning.},

	Abstract = {Our capacity to process and respond behaviourally to multiple incoming stimuli is very limited. To optimize the use of this limited capacity, attentional mechanisms give priority to behaviourally relevant stimuli at the expense of irrelevant distractors. In visual areas, attended stimuli induce enhanced responses and an improved synchronization of rhythmic neuronal activity in the gamma frequency band (40-70 Hz). Both effects probably improve the neuronal signalling of attended stimuli within and among brain areas. Attention also results in improved behavioural performance and shortened reaction times. However, it is not known how reaction times are related to either response strength or gamma-band synchronization in visual areas. Here we show that behavioural response times to a stimulus change can be predicted specifically by the degree of gamma-band synchronization among those neurons in monkey visual area V4 that are activated by the behaviourally relevant stimulus. When there are two visual stimuli and monkeys have to detect a change in one stimulus while ignoring the other, their reactions are fastest when the relevant stimulus induces strong gamma-band synchronization before and after the change in stimulus. This enhanced gamma-band synchronization is also followed by shorter neuronal response latencies on the fast trials. Conversely, the monkeys' reactions are slowest when gamma-band synchronization is high in response to the irrelevant distractor. Thus, enhanced neuronal gamma-band synchronization and shortened neuronal response latencies to an attended stimulus seem to have direct effects on visually triggered behaviour, reflecting an early neuronal correlate of efficient visuo-motor integration.},

	Abstract = {Increasingly systematic approaches to quantifying receptive fields in primary visual cortex, combined with inspired ideas about functional circuitry, non-linearities, and visual stimuli, are bringing new interest to classical problems. This includes the distinction and hierarchy between simple and complex cells, the mechanisms underlying the receptive field surround, and debates about optimal stimuli for mapping receptive fields. An important new problem arises from recent observations of stimulus-dependent spatial and temporal summation in primary visual cortex. It appears that the receptive field can no longer be considered unique, and we might have to relinquish this cherished notion as the embodiment of neuronal function in primary visual cortex.},

@article{fregnac1999a,
	Abstract = {Most algorithms currently used to model synaptic plasticity in self-organizing cortical networks suppose that the change in synaptic efficacy is governed by the same structuring factor, i.e., the temporal correlation of activity between pre- and postsynaptic neurons. Functional predictions generated by such algorithms have been tested electrophysiologically in the visual cortex of anesthetized and paralyzed cats. Supervised learning procedures were applied at the cellular level to change receptive field (RF) properties during the time of recording of an individual functionally identified cell. The protocols were devised as cellular analogs of the plasticity of RF properties, which is normally expressed during a critical period of postnatal development. We summarize here evidence demonstrating that changes in covariance between afferent input and postsynaptic response imposed during extracellular and intracellular conditioning can acutely induce selective long-lasting up- and down-regulations of visual responses. The functional properties that could be modified in 40% of cells submitted to differential pairing protocols include ocular dominance, orientation selectivity and orientation preference, interocular orientation disparity, and the relative dominance of ON and OFF responses. Since changes in RF properties can be induced in the adult as well, our findings also suggest that similar activity-dependent processes may occur during development and during active phases of learning under the supervision of behavioral attention or contextual signals. Such potential for plasticity in primary visual cortical neurons suggests the existence of a hidden connectivity expressing a wider functional competence than the one revealed at the spiking level. In particular, in the spatial domain the sensory synaptic integration field is larger than the classical discharge field. It can be shaped by supervised learning and its subthreshold extent can be unmasked by the pharmacological blockade of intracortical inhibition.},

@article{ingham2005a,
	Abstract = {We investigated the role of GABAergic inhibition on the responses of inferior colliculus (IC) neurons sensitive to interaural time differences (ITDs) in anesthetized guinea pigs. Responses to static and dynamic ITDs were obtained before, during, and after recovery from ionotophoretic application of GABA, or antagonists to the GABA(A) receptor gabazine and bicuculline. For most neurons, a linear relationship was observed between discharge rates evoked by a particular ITD during drug application and control discharge rates. Blocking GABAergic inhibition, or adding exogenous GABA, scaled IC discharge rates in a multiplicative (divisive) and/or additive (subtractive) manner. When the influence of iontophoresed GABA antagonists or exogenous GABA on discharge rates was accounted for, GABAergic inhibition was found to have no effect on the ITD tuning properties of IC neurons. The tuning sharpness of ITD functions, the ITD that evoked 50% response magnitude, and the relative symmetry of ITD functions around their peak response were unaffected by blockade of inhibition or addition of tonic inhibition. However, the ability of neurons to discriminate between ITDs by virtue of differences in their discharge rate was altered by blocking or adding GABA. We propose that inhibition in the IC is involved in the control of the neural gain of the output of IC neurons rather than the regulation of ITD tuning. This gain control appears to arise from a combination of additive and multiplicative processes, and may involve mechanisms such as shunting inhibition or changes in the efficacy of inhibitory and excitatory inputs.},

	Abstract = {Background: The effect of supplementation with a fixed combination of antioxidants (vitamins C and E, beta-carotene and selenium) was monitored on the speed of attaining euthyroidism in a group of patients with Graves' disease, treated with methimazole. Methods: The activity of glutathione peroxidase in whole blood and the concentrations of selenium, pituitary and thyroid hormones in serum were measured, prior to commencement of therapy and after 30 and 60 days. Results: Patients who received supplementation with antioxidants in addition to therapy with methimazole (Group A, n=29) attained euthyroidism faster than the patients treated with only methimazole (Group B, n=28). The concentration of selenium in the serum of patients in Group A increased significantly during treatment (p\textless0.001), while there was no statistically significant change in the patients in Group B. The concentration of selenium in the serum between the groups differed statistically significantly 30 days (p\textless0.05) and 60 days (p\textless0.01) after the commencement of therapy. Activity of glutathione peroxidase in whole blood increased during treatment in both groups of patients. However, a statistically more significant increase occurred in Group A compared to Group B, 30 days after the commencement of therapy (p\textless0.01). Conclusion: The results of the study clearly indicate that supplementation with antioxidants in the treatment of Graves' disease is justified, particularly those containing selenium.},

	Abstract = {We have treated 68 thyrotoxic patients with Graves' disease with a single daily dose of 30 mg methimazole until they were clinically euthyroid and their plasma thyroid hormone concentrations were within normal limits. Sixteen of 56 patients (29%) treated 4.8 +/- 0.2 months (mean +/- SEM; range, 1.5-8.5 for their initial attack of thyrotoxicosis have remained in remission for 54.4 +/- 7.7 months (range, 12-105). Twenty-seven of the patients who relapsed were treated with a subsequent 1-yr course of methimazole. Five of these patients (19%) have maintained a remission for 29.6 +/- 10.8 months (range, 3-66); the remainder relapsed after 7.1 +/- 2.3 months (range, 1-50). If the patients lost to follow-up while known to still be in remission are excluded, the sustained remission rate is 12 of 52 (23%) for initial short term therapy and 3 of 25 (12%) for the subsequent 1-yr of antithyroid treatment. The results of short term antithyroid drug treatment in 12 patients previously treated with long term antithyroid drugs or thyroidectomy were similar, but the follow-up period was not as long. Short term antithyroid drug therapy is a potentially long lasting, innocuous, and relatively inexpensive program for the treatment of Graves' disease, especially for patients with small goiters.},

The use of voltage-sensitive dyes and the recent development of the use of an array of photodiodes has provided a unique technique for monitoring the dynamic patterns of electrical activity in real time from a variety of invertebrate or vertebrate neuronal preparations including the rat cortex. In the present study, this technique has been used to investigate the intact optic tectum of the frog. We demonstrate that optical measurements can be used for real-time imaging of spatio-temporal patterns of neuronal responses and for identification of functional units evoked by natural visual stimuli. We report also the structure of the new voltage-sensitive probe that facilitates the in vivo applications of this technique.},

In addition, only at sites in areas 17/18 did the local field potential exhibit locking to a horizontal motion pattern extracted from a natural movie. These results suggest that area 21a is concerned with the analysis of spatial features but lacks a faithful representation of temporal features. Hence, they foster the hypothesis that cortical area 21a is part of a ventral form pathway.},

	Abstract = {Spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) as a Hebbian synaptic learning rule has been demonstrated in various neural circuits over a wide spectrum of species, from insects to humans. The dependence of synaptic modification on the order of pre- and postsynaptic spiking within a critical window of tens of milliseconds has profound functional implications. Over the past decade, significant progress has been made in understanding the cellular mechanisms of STDP at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses and of the associated changes in neuronal excitability and synaptic integration. Beyond the basic asymmetric window, recent studies have also revealed several layers of complexity in STDP, including its dependence on dendritic location, the nonlinear integration of synaptic modification induced by complex spike trains, and the modulation of STDP by inhibitory and neuromodulatory inputs. Finally, the functional consequences of STDP have been examined directly in an increasing number of neural circuits in vivo. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Neuroscience Volume 31 is June 16, 2008. Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/catalog/pubdates.aspx for revised estimates.},

@article{parkhurst2003a,
	Abstract = {The primate visual system actively selects visual information from the environment for detailed processing through mechanisms of visual attention and saccadic eye movements. This study examines the statistical properties of the scene content selected by active vision. Eye movements were recorded while participants free-viewed digitized images of natural and artificial scenes. Fixation locations were determined for each image and image patches were extracted around the observed fixation locations. Measures of local contrast, local spatial correlation and spatial frequency content were calculated on the extracted image patches. Replicating previous results, local contrast was found to be greater at the points of fixation when compared to either the contrast for image patches extracted at random locations or at the observed fixation locations using an image-shuffled database. Contrary to some results and in agreement with other results in the literature, a significant decorrelation of image intensity is observed between the locations of fixation and other neighboring locations. A discussion and analysis of methodological techniques is given that provides an explanation for the discrepancy in results. The results of our analyses indicate that both the local contrast and correlation at the points of fixation are a function of image type and, furthermore, that the magnitude of these effects depend on the levels of contrast and correlation present overall in the images. Finally, the largest effect sizes in local contrast and correlation are found at distances of approximately 1 deg of visual angle, which agrees well with measures of optimal spatial scale selectivity in the visual periphery where visual information for potential saccade targets is processed.},

	Abstract = {Two components of cortical circuits could mediate contour integration in primary visual cortex (V1): intrinsic horizontal connections and feedback from higher cortical areas. To distinguish between these, we combined functional mapping with a new technique for labeling axons, a recombinant adenovirus bearing the gene for green fluorescent protein (GFP), to determine the extent, density, and orientation specificity of V1 intrinsic connections and V2 to V1 feedback. Both connections cover portions of V1 representing regions of visual space up to eight times larger than receptive fields as classically defined, though the intrinsic connections are an order of magnitude denser than the feedback. Whereas the intrinsic connections link similarly oriented domains in V1, V2 to V1 feedback displays no such specificity. These findings suggest that V1 intrinsic horizontal connections provide a more likely substrate for contour integration.},

	Abstract = {Perceptual events derive their significance to an animal from their meaning about the world, that is from the information they carry about their causes. The brain should thus be able to efficiently infer the causes underlying our sensory events. Here we use multisensory cue combination to study causal inference in perception. We formulate an ideal-observer model that infers whether two sensory cues originate from the same location and that also estimates their location(s). This model accurately predicts the nonlinear integration of cues by human subjects in two auditory-visual localization tasks. The results show that indeed humans can efficiently infer the causal structure as well as the location of causes. By combining insights from the study of causal inference with the ideal-observer approach to sensory cue combination, we show that the capacity to infer causal structure is not limited to conscious, high-level cognition; it is also performed continually and effortlessly in perception.},

	Abstract = {The perception of blur in images can be strongly affected by prior adaptation to blurry images or by spatial induction from blurred surrounds. These contextual effects may play a role in calibrating visual responses for the spatial structure of luminance variations in images. We asked whether similar adjustments might also calibrate the visual system for spatial variations in color. Observers adjusted the amplitude spectra of luminance or chromatic images until they appeared correctly focused, and repeated these measurements either before or after adaptation to blurred or sharpened images or in the presence of blurred or sharpened surrounds. Prior adaptation induced large and distinct changes in perceived focus for both luminance and chromatic patterns, suggesting that luminance and chromatic mechanisms are both able to adjust to changes in the level of blur. However, judgments of focus were more variable for color, and unlike luminance there was little effect of surrounding spatial context on perceived blur. In additional measurements we explored the effects of adaptation on threshold contrast sensitivity for luminance and color. Adaptation to filtered noise with a 1/f spectrum characteristic of natural images strongly and selectively elevated thresholds at low spatial frequencies for both luminance and color, thus transforming the chromatic contrast sensitivity function from lowpass to nearly bandpass. These threshold changes were found to reflect interactions between different spatial scales that bias sensitivity against the lowest spatial grain in the image, and may reflect adaptation to different stimulus attributes than the attributes underlying judgments of image focus. Our results suggest that spatial sensitivity for variations in color can be strongly shaped by adaptation to the spatial structure of the stimulus, but point to dissociations in these visual adjustments both between luminance and color and different measures of spatial sensitivity.},

	Abstract = {How do cortical neurons represent the acoustic environment? This question is often addressed by probing with simple stimuli such as clicks or tone pips. Such stimuli have the advantage of yielding easily interpreted answers, but have the disadvantage that they may fail to uncover complex or higher-order neuronal response properties. Here, we adopt an alternative approach, probing neuronal responses with complex acoustic stimuli, including animal vocalizations. We used in vivo whole-cell methods in the rat auditory cortex to record subthreshold membrane potential fluctuations elicited by these stimuli. Most neurons responded robustly and reliably to the complex stimuli in our ensemble. Using regularization techniques, we estimated the linear component, the spectrotemporal receptive field (STRF), of the transformation from the sound (as represented by its time-varying spectrogram) to the membrane potential of the neuron. We find that the STRF has a rich dynamical structure, including excitatory regions positioned in general accord with the prediction of the classical tuning curve. However, whereas the STRF successfully predicts the responses to some of the natural stimuli, it surprisingly fails completely to predict the responses to others; on average, only 11% of the response power could be predicted by the STRF. Therefore, most of the response of the neuron cannot be predicted by the linear component, although the response is deterministically related to the stimulus. Analysis of the systematic errors of the STRF model shows that this failure cannot be attributed to simple nonlinearities such as adaptation to mean intensity, rectification, or saturation. Rather, the highly nonlinear response properties of auditory cortical neurons must be attributable to nonlinear interactions between sound frequencies and time-varying properties of the neural encoder.},

	Abstract = {Sensory regions of neocortex are organized as arrays of vertical columns composed of cells that share similar response properties, with the orientation columns of the cat's visual cortex being the best known example. Interest in how sensitivity to different stimulus features first emerges in the columns and how this selectivity is refined by subsequent processing has fueled decades of research. A natural starting point in approaching these issues is anatomy. Each column traverses the six cortical layers and each layer has a unique pattern of inputs, intrinsic connections and outputs. Thus, it makes sense to explore the possibility of corresponding laminar differences in sensory function, that is, to examine relationships between morphology and physiology. In addition, to help identify general patterns of cortical organization, it is useful to compare results obtained from different sensory systems and diverse species. The picture that emerges from such comparisons is that each cortical layer serves a distinct role in sensory function. Furthermore, different cortices appear to share some common strategies for processing information but also have specialized mechanisms adapted for the demands of specific sensory tasks.},

	Abstract = {Whereas the rules underlying the perceived intensity of binary mixtures have been investigated, minimal efforts have been directed at elucidating the rules underlying the perceived pleasantness of such mixtures. To address this, 84 subjects ranked the pleasantness and intensity of 5 distinct binary mixtures (15 pairs, inter-stimulus interval = 4 s, inter-trial interval = 30 s, flow = 6 l/min, pulse = 2 s) constructed from different ratios (0:100%, 25:75%, 50:50%, 75:25%, and 100:0%, olfactometer-generated vapor phase). We found that in the majority of cases, the pleasantness of the mixture fell between the pleasantness values of its separated constituents and that it was strongly influenced by the relative intensities of the constituents. Based on these results, we proposed a prediction paradigm for the pleasantness of binary mixtures from the pleasantness of their separated constituents weighted by their respective perceived intensities. The uniqueness of the proposed paradigm is that it neither requires presetting an interaction constant between the mixture components nor require any factorization of the pleasantness weights. It does, nonetheless, require solid psychophysical data on the separated components at their different concentrations, and currently it can only explain the behavior of intermediate pleasantness of mixtures.},

	Abstract = {We studied mu-opioid transmission in acute slices of rat neocortex using whole-cell recordings and single-cell reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The mu-opioid receptor (MOR) was found in gamma-aminobutyric acidergic (GABAergic) interneurons that were either layer I cells frequently expressing neuropeptide Y or layers II-V cells expressing vasoactive intestinal peptide and enkephalin (Enk). We found that mu-opioid agonists inhibit these interneurons that are selectively excited by nicotinic agonists. The extensive overlap of mu-opioid and nicotinic responsiveness allowed mu-opioid agonists to inhibit nicotinic excitation of responsive interneurons and of their GABAergic output onto pyramidal cells. Finally, nicotinic stimulation resulted in a dynamic sequence where GABAergic transmission was first enhanced and then depressed below its baseline. This latter disinhibitory effect was prevented by a mu-opioid antagonist, indicating that excitation of nicotinic-responsive interneurons induced the release of endogenous Enk, which in turn led to MOR activation. Our results suggest that neocortical mu-opioid transmission acts as an inhibitory feedback onto nicotinic-responsive interneurons, which may change network excitability and inhibition patterns during cholinergic excitation.},

This map awards higher responses to more salient image locations; these responses are those of conventional V1 cells tuned to input features, such as orientation and color. Hence no separate feature maps, or any subsequent combination of them, is needed to create a saliency map. I use a model to show that this saliency map accounts for the way that the relative difficulties of visual search tasks depend on the features and spatial configurations of targets and distractors. This proposal links psychophysical behavior to V1 physiology and anatomy, and thereby makes testable predictions.},

	Abstract = {To explore the role of visual area V2 in shape analysis, we studied the responses of neurons in area V2 of the alert macaque using a set of 128 grating and geometric line stimuli that varied in their shape characteristics and geometric complexity. Simple stimuli included oriented bars and sinusoidal gratings; complex stimuli included angles, arcs, circles, and intersecting lines, plus hyperbolic and polar gratings. We found that most V2 cells responded well to at least some of the complex stimuli, and in many V2 cells the most effective complex stimulus elicited a significantly larger response than the most effective bar or sinusoid. Approximately one-third of the V2 cells showed significant differential responsiveness to various complex shape characteristics, and many were also selective for the orientation, size, and/or spatial frequency of the preferred shape. These results indicate that V2 cells explicitly represent complex shape information and suggest specific types of higher order visual information that V2 cells extract from visual scenes.},

	Abstract = {Humans demonstrate a peculiar ability to detect complex targets in rapidly presented natural scenes. Recent studies suggest that (nearly) no focal attention is required for overall performance in such tasks. Little is known, however, of how detection performance varies from trial to trial and which stages in the processing hierarchy limit performance: bottom-up visual processing (attentional selection and/or recognition) or top-down factors (e.g., decision-making, memory, or alertness fluctuations)? To investigate the relative contribution of these factors, eight human observers performed an animal detection task in natural scenes presented at 20 Hz. Trial-by-trial performance was highly consistent across observers, far exceeding the prediction of independent errors. This consistency demonstrates that performance is not primarily limited by idiosyncratic factors but by visual processing. Two statistical stimulus properties, contrast variation in the target image and the information-theoretical measure of "surprise" in adjacent images, predict performance on a trial-by-trial basis. These measures are tightly related to spatial attention, demonstrating that spatial attention and rapid target detection share common mechanisms. To isolate the causal contribution of the surprise measure, eight additional observers performed the animal detection task in sequences that were reordered versions of those all subjects had correctly recognized in the first experiment. Reordering increased surprise before and/or after the target while keeping the target and distractors themselves unchanged. Surprise enhancement impaired target detection in all observers. Consequently, and contrary to several previously published findings, our results demonstrate that attentional limitations, rather than target recognition alone, affect the detection of targets in rapidly presented visual sequences.},

	Abstract = {The spatial and temporal patterns of neocortex activation are determined not only by the dynamic character of the input but also by the intrinsic dynamics of the cortical circuitry. To study the role of afferent input frequency on cortical activation dynamics, the electrical activity of in vitro neocortex slices was imaged during white-matter electrical stimulation. High-speed optical imaging was implemented using voltage-sensitive dyes in guinea pig visual and somatosensory cortex slices concomitantly with intracellular recordings. Single white-matter electrical stimuli activated well-defined cortical sites with a radially oriented columnar configuration. This configuration was followed, over the next few milliseconds, by a lateral spread of excitation through cortical layers 5 and 6 and layers 2 and 3. Much of the optical response was eliminated in low extracellular calcium, indicating that it was primarily synaptically mediated. Repetitive stimuli at 10 Hz reproduced the spatiotemporal pattern observed for single stimuli. In contrast, repetitive stimulation in the gamma frequency range ( approximately 40 Hz) rapidly restrained the area of excitation to a small columnar site directly above the stimulating electrode. Intracellular recordings from cells lateral to the activated column revealed increased inhibitory synaptic activity and/or decreased excitatory responses during the train at 40 Hz, but not during a 10 Hz stimulation. Localized microinjections of GABA(A) antagonist produced a reorganization of the geometrical activity pattern that was dependent on the position of the microinjection site. These findings indicate that the frequency-dependent spatial organization of neocortex activation is determined by inhibitory sculpting attributable to local network dynamics.},

	Abstract = {Temporal coding is a means of representing information by the time, as opposed to the rate, at which neurons fire. Evidence of temporal coding in the hippocampus comes from place cells, whose spike times relative to theta oscillations reflect a rat's position while running along stereotyped trajectories. This arises from the backwards shift in cell firing relative to local theta oscillations (phase precession). Here we demonstrate phase precession during place-field crossings in an open-field foraging task. This produced spike sequences in each theta cycle that disambiguate the rat's trajectory through two-dimensional space and can be used to predict movement direction. Furthermore, position and movement direction were maximally predicted from firing in the early and late portions of the theta cycle, respectively. This represents the first direct evidence of a combined representation of position, trajectory and heading in the hippocampus, organized on a fine temporal scale by theta oscillations.},

	Abstract = {The natural communication of apes may hold clues about language origins, especially because apes frequently gesture with limbs and hands, a mode of communication thought to have been the starting point of human language evolution. The present study aimed to contrast brachiomanual gestures with orofacial movements and vocalizations in the natural communication of our closest primate relatives, bonobos (Pan paniscus) and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). We tested whether gesture is the more flexible form of communication by measuring the strength of association between signals and specific behavioral contexts, comparing groups of both the same and different ape species. Subjects were two captive bonobo groups, a total of 13 individuals, and two captive chimpanzee groups, a total of 34 individuals. The study distinguished 31 manual gestures and 18 facial/vocal signals. It was found that homologous facial/vocal displays were used very similarly by both ape species, yet the same did not apply to gestures. Both within and between species gesture usage varied enormously. Moreover, bonobos showed greater flexibility in this regard than chimpanzees and were also the only species in which multimodal communication (i.e., combinations of gestures and facial/vocal signals) added to behavioral impact on the recipient.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recently, activation-dependant structural brain plasticity in humans has been demonstrated in adults after three months of training a visio-motor skill. Learning three-ball cascade juggling was associated with a transient and highly selective increase in brain gray matter in the occipito-temporal cortex comprising the motion sensitive area hMT/V5 bilaterally. However, the exact time-scale of usage-dependant structural changes occur is still unknown. A better understanding of the temporal parameters may help to elucidate to what extent this type of cortical plasticity contributes to fast adapting cortical processes that may be relevant to learning. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using a 3 Tesla scanner and monitoring whole brain structure we repeated and extended our original study in 20 healthy adult volunteers, focussing on the temporal aspects of the structural changes and investigated whether these changes are performance or exercise dependant. The data confirmed our earlier observation using a mean effects analysis and in addition showed that learning to juggle can alter gray matter in the occipito-temporal cortex as early as after 7 days of training. Neither performance nor exercise alone could explain these changes. CONCLUSION: We suggest that the qualitative change (i.e. learning of a new task) is more critical for the brain to change its structure than continued training of an already-learned task.},

	Abstract = {The cerebral cortex is organized so that an important component of feedback input from higher to lower cortical areas arrives at the distal apical tufts of pyramidal neurons. Yet, distal inputs are predicted to have much less impact on firing than proximal inputs. Here we show that even weak asynchronous dendritic input to the distal tuft region can significantly increase the gain of layer 5 pyramidal neurons and thereby the output of columns in the primary somatosensory cortex of the rat. Noisy currents injected in ramps at different dendritic locations showed that the initial slope of the frequency-current (f/I) relationship increases with the distance of the current injection from the soma. The increase was due to the interaction of dendritic depolarization with back-propagating APs which activated dendritic calcium conductances. Gain increases were accompanied by a change of firing mode from isolated spikes to bursting where the timing of bursts coded the presence of coincident somatic and dendritic inputs. We propose that this dendritic gain modulation and the timing of bursts may serve to associate top-down and bottom-up input on different time scales.},

	Abstract = {We report a systematic relationship between sound-frequency tuning and sensitivity to interaural time delays for neurons in the midbrain nucleus of the inferior colliculus; neurons with relatively low best frequencies (BFs) showed response peaks at long delays, whereas neurons with relatively high BFs showed response peaks at short delays. The consequence of this relationship is that the steepest region of the function relating discharge rate to interaural time delay (ITD) fell close to midline for all neurons irrespective of BF. These data provide support for a processing of the output of coincidence detectors subserving low-frequency sound localization in which the location of a sound source is determined by the activity in two broad, hemispheric spatial channels, rather than numerous channels tuned to discrete spatial positions.},

	Abstract = {Steady state responses to the sinusoidal modulation of the amplitude or frequency of a tone were recorded from the human scalp. For both amplitude modulation (AM) and frequency modulation (FM), the responses were most consistent at modulation frequencies between 30 and 50 Hz. However, reliable responses could also be recorded at lower frequencies, particularly at 2-5 Hz for AM and at 3-7 Hz for FM. With increasing modulation depth at 40 Hz, both the AM and FM response increased in amplitude, but the AM response tended to saturate at large modulation depths. Neither response showed any significant change in phase with changes in modulation depth. Both responses increased in amplitude and decreased in phase delay with increasing intensity of the carrier tone, the FM response showing some saturation of amplitude at high intensities. Both responses could be recorded at modulation depths close to the subjective threshold for detecting the modulation and at intensities close to the subjective threshold for hearing the stimulus. The responses were variable but did not consistently adapt over periods of 10 min. The 40-Hz AM and FM responses appear to originate in the same generator, this generator being activated by separate auditory systems that detect changes in either amplitude or frequency.},

@article{tsapatsoulis2007a,
	Abstract = {In this paper we propose a novel saliency-based computational model for visual attention. This model processes both top-down (goal directed) and bottom-up information. Processing in the top-down channel creates the so called skin conspicuity map and emulates the visual search for human faces performed by humans. This is clearly a goal directed task but is generic enough to be context independent. Processing in the bottom-up information channel follows the principles set by Itti et al. but it deviates from them by computing the orientation, intensity and color conspicuity maps within a unified multi-resolution framework based on wavelet subband analysis. In particular, we apply a wavelet based approach for efficient computation of the topographic feature maps. Given that wavelets and multiresolution theory are naturally connected the usage of wavelet decomposition for mimicking the center surround process in humans is an obvious choice. However, our implementation goes further. We utilize the wavelet decomposition for inline computation of the features (such as orientation angles) that are used to create the topographic feature maps. The bottom-up topographic feature maps and the top-down skin conspicuity map are then combined through a sigmoid function to produce the final saliency map. A prototype of the proposed model was realized through the TMDSDMK642-0E DSP platform as an embedded system allowing real-time operation. For evaluation purposes, in terms of perceived visual quality and video compression improvement, a ROI-based video compression setup was followed. Extended experiments concerning both MPEG-1 as well as low bit-rate MPEG-4 video encoding were conducted showing significant improvement in video compression efficiency without perceived deterioration in visual quality.},

	Abstract = {Areas beyond the classical receptive field (CRF) can modulate responses of the majority of cells in the primary visual cortex of the cat (). Although general characteristics of this phenomenon have been reported previously, little is known about the detailed spatial organization of the surrounds. Previous work suggests that the surrounds may be uniform regions that encircle the CRF or may be limited to the "ends" of the CRF. We have examined the spatial organization of surrounds of single-cell receptive fields in the primary visual cortex of anesthetized, paralyzed cats. The CRF was stimulated with an optimal drifting grating, whereas the surround was probed with a second small grating patch placed at discrete locations around the CRF. For most cells that exhibit suppression, the surrounds are spatially asymmetric, such that the suppression originates from a localized region. We find a variety of suppressive zone locations, but there is a slight bias for suppression to occur at the end zones of the CRF. The spatial pattern of suppression is independent of the parameters of the suppressive stimulus used, although the effect is clearest with iso-oriented surround stimuli. A subset of cells exhibit axially symmetric or uniform surround fields. These results demonstrate that the surrounds are more specific than previously realized, and this specialization has implications for the processing of visual information in the primary visual cortex. One possibility is that these localized surrounds may provide a substrate for figure-ground segmentation of visual scenes.},

	Abstract = {Studies on processing in primary visual areas often use artificial stimuli such as bars or gratings. As a result, little is known about the properties of activity patterns for the natural stimuli processed by the visual system on a daily basis. Furthermore, in the cat, a well-studied model system for visual processing, most results are obtained from anesthetized subjects and little is known about neuronal activations in the alert animal. Addressing these issues, we measure local field potentials (lfp) and multiunit spikes in the primary visual cortex of awake cats. We compare changes in the lfp power spectra and multiunit firing rates for natural movies, movies with modified spatio-temporal correlations as well as gratings. The activity patterns elicited by drifting gratings are qualitatively and quantitatively different from those elicited by natural stimuli and this difference arises from both spatial as well as temporal properties of the stimuli. Furthermore, both local field potentials and multiunit firing rates are most sensitive to the second-order statistics of the stimuli and not to their higher-order properties. Finally, responses to natural movies show a large variability over time because of activity fluctuations induced by rapid stimulus motion. We show that these fluctuations are not dependent on the detailed spatial properties of the stimuli but depend on their temporal jitter. These fluctuations are important characteristics of visual activity under natural conditions and impose limitations on the readout of possible differences in mean activity levels.},

@article{horton2005a,
	Abstract = {This year, the field of neuroscience celebrates the 50th anniversary of Mountcastle's discovery of the cortical column. In this review, we summarize half a century of research and come to the disappointing realization that the column may have no function. Originally, it was described as a discrete structure, spanning the layers of the somatosensory cortex, which contains cells responsive to only a single modality, such as deep joint receptors or cutaneous receptors. Subsequently, examples of columns have been uncovered in numerous cortical areas, expanding the original concept to embrace a variety of different structures and principles. A "column" now refers to cells in any vertical cluster that share the same tuning for any given receptive field attribute. In striate cortex, for example, cells with the same eye preference are grouped into ocular dominance columns. Unaccountably, ocular dominance columns are present in some species, but not others. In principle, it should be possible to determine their function by searching for species differences in visual performance that correlate with their presence or absence. Unfortunately, this approach has been to no avail; no visual faculty has emerged that appears to require ocular dominance columns. Moreover, recent evidence has shown that the expression of ocular dominance columns can be highly variable among members of the same species, or even in different portions of the visual cortex in the same individual. These observations deal a fatal blow to the idea that ocular dominance columns serve a purpose. More broadly, the term "column" also denotes the periodic termination of anatomical projections within or between cortical areas. In many instances, periodic projections have a consistent relationship with some architectural feature, such as the cytochrome oxidase patches in V1 or the stripes in V2. These tissue compartments appear to divide cells with different receptive field properties into distinct processing streams. However, it is unclear what advantage, if any, is conveyed by this form of columnar segregation. Although the column is an attractive concept, it has failed as a unifying principle for understanding cortical function. Unravelling the organization of the cerebral cortex will require a painstaking description of the circuits, projections and response properties peculiar to cells in each of its various areas.},

	Abstract = {Spiking neurons translate analog intracellular variables into a sequence of action potentials. A simplified model of this transformation is one in which an underlying "generator potential," representing a measure of overall neuronal drive, is passed through a static nonlinearity to produce an instantaneous firing rate. An important question is how adaptive mechanisms adjust the mean and SD of the generator potential to define an "operating point" that controls spike generation. In early sensory pathways adaptation has been shown to rescale the generator potential to maximize the amount of transmitted information. In contrast, we demonstrate that the operating point in the cortex is tuned so that cells respond only when the generator potential executes a large excursion above its mean value. The distance from the mean of the generator potential to spike threshold is, on average, 1 SD of the ongoing activity. Signals above threshold are amplified linearly and do not reach saturation. The operating point is adjusted dynamically so that it remains relatively invariant despite changes in stimulus contrast. We conclude that the operating regimen of the cortex is suitable for the detection of signals in background noise and for enhancing the selectivity of spike responses relative to those of the generator potential (the so-called "iceberg effect"), but not to maximize the transmission of total information.},

	Annote = {In this study, the relationship between Generator potential and the spiking activity is investigated. What is Generator Potential ? "First, in the simple linear--nonlinear model the generator potential represents an underlying variable that conveys information about the instantaneous probability of spiking. One should be careful not to assume that the generator potential has a direct biophysical interpretation, such as representing the membrane potential of the cell, membrane conductance, or synaptic currents. Indeed, both experimental and theoretical studies suggests that the generator potential is better understood as representing a combination of the history of intracellular variables that results in an single measure overall of neuronal drive (Lankheet et al., 1989; Anderson et al., 2000b; Aguera y Arcas and Fairhall, 2003; Aguera y Arcas et al., 2003)." They present to cats a set of sinusoidal gratings for 20 ms each at different levels of contrasts. They derive the spatial RF from spikes and from these RF they estimate generator potential. From these generator potentials they derive the function f(potential) = spike. Prior to this they z-score the generator potential so that x-axis is expressed in terms of SD of the GP. their finding can be summarized as: 1/ most of the cells have a threshold of 1SD independent of the contrast. The threshold is not determined in an absolute scale but rather adapts to the SD of the GP. in low contrast stimuluation SD of GP is low this results in an decrease of the threshold. Moreover the transition elbow of the rectification was quite sharp and there was virtually no saturation. "This finding is consistent with the invariance of transmitted information under different stimulus conditions recently described in the barrel cortex (Maravall et al., 2007). " "the operating point of the cortex is such that cells behave as ``large-deviation detectors.''" "Previous studies have suggested that adaptive mechanisms work primarily to maximize the faithful transmission of informa- tion, given the statistics of the underlying signal (Laughlin, 1981; Smirnakis et al., 1997; van Hateren, 1997; Brenner et al., 2000). In the LGN, where we have shown that thresholds are near zero and two populations of cells (ON/OFF) are known to code for the sign of the fluctuations, these ideas may be applicable. Our findings indicate that in the cortex, however, this cannot be the case. Clearly, by clipping the signals below a threshold of},

	Abstract = {Background: An association between radioiodine therapy (RAI) for Graves' disease (GD) and the development or worsening of Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO) is widely quoted but there has been no systematic review of the evidence. Aims: We undertook a systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to assess whether RAI for GD is associated with increased risk of ophthalmopathy compared with antithyroid drugs (ATDs) or surgery. We also assessed the efficacy of glucocorticoid prophylaxis in the prevention of occurrence or progression of ophthalmopathy, when used with RAI. Methods: We identified RCTs regardless of language or publication status by searching six databases and trial registries. Dual, blinded data abstraction and quality assessment were undertaken. Random effects meta-analyses were used to combine the study data. Ten RCTs involving 1136 patients permitted 13 comparisons. Two RCTs compared RAI with ATD. Two RCTs compared RAI with thyroidectomy. Four RCTs compared the use of adjunctive ATD with RAI versus RAI. Five RCTs examined the use of glucocorticoid prophylaxis with RAI. Results: RAI was associated with an increased risk of ophthalmopathy compared with ATD (Relative Risk (RR) 4.23, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.04 to 8.77) but compared with thyroidectomy, there was no statistically significant increased risk (RR 1.59, 95% CI 0.89 to 2.81). The risk of severe GO was also increased with RAI compared with ATD (RR 4.35, 95% CI 1.28 to 14.73). Prednisolone prophylaxis for RAI was highly effective in preventing the progression of GO in patients with pre-existing GO (RR 0.03; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.24). The use of adjunctive ATD with RAI was not associated with any significant benefit on the course of GO. Conclusion: Radioiodine therapy for Graves' disease is associated with a small but definite increased risk of development or worsening of Graves' ophthalmopathy compared with antithyroid drugs. Steroid prophylaxis is beneficial for patients with pre-existing Graves' ophthalmopathy.},

	Abstract = {1. We recorded responses from neurons in area V1 of the alert macaque monkey to textured patterns modeled after stimuli used in psychophysical experiments of pop-out. Neuronal responses to a single oriented line segment placed within a cell's classical receptive field (CRF) were compared with responses in which the center element was surrounded by rings of elements placed entirely outside the CRF. The orientations of the surround elements either matched the center element, were orthogonal to it, or were random. 2. The addition of the textured surround tended to suppress the response to the center element by an average of 34%. Overall, almost 80% of the 122 cells analyzed in detail were significantly suppressed by at least one of the texture surrounds. 3. Cells tended to respond more strongly to a stimulus in which there was a contrast in orientation between the center and surround than to a stimulus lacking such contrast. The average difference was 9% of the response to the optimally oriented center element alone. For the 32% of the cells showing a statistically significant orientation contrast effect, the average difference was 28%. 4. Both the general suppression and orientation contrast effects originated from surround regions at the ends of the center bar as well as regions along the sides of the center bar. 5. The amount of suppression induced by the texture surround decreased as the density of the texture elements decreased. 6. Both the general suppression and the orientation contrast effects appeared early in the population response to the stimuli. The general suppression effect took approximately 7 ms to develop, whereas the orientation contrast effect took 18-20 ms to develop. 7. These results are consistent with a possible functional role of V1 cells in the mediation of perceptual pop-out and in the segregation of texture borders. Possible anatomic substrates of the effects are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Radioactive iodine ((131)I) has become the most widely used therapy for patients with hyperthyroidism caused by Graves' disease in the United States. There remains, however, significant variability among (131)I dosing regimens, and it is clear that most patients ultimately develop hypothyroidism after therapy. To avoid persistent hyperthyroidism, we adopted a high dose (131)I therapy protocol based on measurement of 24-h thyroid (123)I uptake designed to deliver 8 mCi (296 MBq) to the thyroid gland 24 h after (131)I administration. To evaluate the efficacy of this protocol, we reviewed our clinical experience over a 7-yr period. We treated 261 patients (219 women and 42 men) with hyperthyroidism caused by Graves' disease with (131)I [mean dose, 14.6 mCi (540 MBq)] between 1993 and 1999. Before treatment, 207 (79%) had received an antithyroid drug (109 propylthiouracil and 98 methimazole). We determined their thyroid status 1 yr after treatment in relation to age, pretreatment with an antithyroid drug, pretreatment thyroid size, and dose of (131)I retained in the thyroid 24 h after treatment. Among the 261 patients, 225 (86%) were euthyroid or hypothyroid 1 yr after treatment, and 36 patients (14%) had persistent hyperthyroidism and required a second treatment. The patients who had persistent hyperthyroidism were younger (P < 0.01), had larger thyroid glands (P < 0.01), higher pretreatment thyroid (123)I uptake values (P < 0.01), and higher serum T(4) concentrations (P < 0.01) and were more likely to have taken antithyroid medication before administration of (131)I (P = 0.01). Five of these patients developed transient hypothyroidism, followed by thyrotoxicosis. There was an asymptotic, inverse relationship between the retained dose of (131)I at 24 h and persistent hyperthyroidism, revealing a 5-10% failure rate despite delivery of up to 400 microCi (14.8 MBq)/g. A dose of (131)I that results in accumulation of 8 mCi (296 MBq) in the thyroid gland 24 h after administration is an effective treatment for the majority of patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism. Young patients with larger thyroid glands, higher serum T(4) concentrations, and higher 24-h thyroid (123)I uptake values, and those pretreated with antithyroid medication for greater than 4 months are at higher risk for treatment failure. A higher dose of (131)I may be advisable in such patients.},

	Abstract = {We present six experiments that tested whether lacking control increases illusory pattern perception, which we define as the identification of a coherent and meaningful interrelationship among a set of random or unrelated stimuli. Participants who lacked control were more likely to perceive a variety of illusory patterns, including seeing images in noise, forming illusory correlations in stock market information, perceiving conspiracies, and developing superstitions. Additionally, we demonstrated that increased pattern perception has a motivational basis by measuring the need for structure directly and showing that the causal link between lack of control and illusory pattern perception is reduced by affirming the self. Although these many disparate forms of pattern perception are typically discussed as separate phenomena, the current results suggest that there is a common motive underlying them.},

	Abstract = {Spontaneous cortical activity--ongoing activity in the absence of intentional sensory input--has been studied extensively, using methods ranging from EEG (electroencephalography), through voltage sensitive dye imaging, down to recordings from single neurons. Ongoing cortical activity has been shown to play a critical role in development, and must also be essential for processing sensory perception, because it modulates stimulus-evoked activity, and is correlated with behaviour. Yet its role in the processing of external information and its relationship to internal representations of sensory attributes remains unknown. Using voltage sensitive dye imaging, we previously established a close link between ongoing activity in the visual cortex of anaesthetized cats and the spontaneous firing of a single neuron. Here we report that such activity encompasses a set of dynamically switching cortical states, many of which correspond closely to orientation maps. When such an orientation state emerged spontaneously, it spanned several hypercolumns and was often followed by a state corresponding to a proximal orientation. We suggest that dynamically switching cortical states could represent the brain's internal context, and therefore reflect or influence memory, perception and behaviour.},

	Abstract = {Information theory quantifies how much information a neural response carries about the stimulus. This can be compared to the information transferred in particular models of the stimulus-response function and to maximum possible information transfer. Such comparisons are crucial because they validate assumptions present in any neurophysiological analysis. Here we review information-theory basics before demonstrating its use in neural coding. We show how to use information theory to validate simple stimulus-response models of neural coding of dynamic stimuli. Because these models require specification of spike timing precision, they can reveal which time scales contain information in neural coding. This approach shows that dynamic stimuli can be encoded efficiently by single neurons and that each spike contributes to information transmission. We argue, however, that the data obtained so far do not suggest a temporal code, in which the placement of spikes relative to each other yields additional information.},

	Abstract = {The cerebral cortex is a remarkably homogeneous structure suggesting a rather generic computational machinery. Indeed, under a variety of conditions, functions attributed to specialized areas can be supported by other regions. However, a host of studies have laid out an ever more detailed map of functional cortical areas. This leaves us with the puzzle of whether different cortical areas are intrinsically specialized, or whether they differ mostly by their position in the processing hierarchy and their inputs but apply the same computational principles. Here we show that the computational principle of optimal stability of sensory representations combined with local memory gives rise to a hierarchy of processing stages resembling the ventral visual pathway when it is exposed to continuous natural stimuli. Early processing stages show receptive fields similar to those observed in the primary visual cortex. Subsequent stages are selective for increasingly complex configurations of local features, as observed in higher visual areas. The last stage of the model displays place fields as observed in entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. The results suggest that functionally heterogeneous cortical areas can be generated by only a few computational principles and highlight the importance of the variability of the input signals in forming functional specialization.},

On successful trials, neurons in the frontal eye field not only discriminated the target from distractors, but also discriminated distractors that shared a target feature as well as distractors that had been the search target during the previous session. Likewise, occasional errant saccades tended to direct gaze to distractors that either resembled the current target or had been the previous target. These findings show that the frontal eye field is involved in visual and not just motor selection and that visual selection is influenced by long-term priming. The data support the hypothesis that visual selection can be accomplished by parallel processing of objects based on their elementary features.},

	Abstract = {Knowledge of objects in the world is stored in our brains as rich, multimodal representations. Because the neural pathways that process this diverse sensory information are largely anatomically distinct, a fundamental challenge to cognitive neuroscience is to explain how the brain binds the different sensory features that comprise an object to form meaningful, multimodal object representations. Studies with nonhuman primates suggest that a structure at the culmination of the object recognition system (the perirhinal cortex) performs this critical function. In contrast, human neuroimaging studies implicate the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS). The results of the functional MRI study reported here resolve this apparent discrepancy by demonstrating that both pSTS and the perirhinal cortex contribute to crossmodal binding in humans, but in different ways. Significantly, only perirhinal cortex activity is modulated by meaning variables (e.g., semantic congruency and semantic category), suggesting that these two regions play complementary functional roles, with pSTS acting as a presemantic, heteromodal region for crossmodal perceptual features, and perirhinal cortex integrating these features into higher-level conceptual representations. This interpretation is supported by the results of our behavioral study: Patients with lesions, including the perirhinal cortex, but not patients with damage restricted to frontal cortex, were impaired on the same crossmodal integration task, and their performance was significantly influenced by the same semantic factors, mirroring the functional MRI findings. These results integrate nonhuman and human primate research by providing converging evidence that human perirhinal cortex is also critically involved in processing meaningful aspects of multimodal object representations.},

@article{peli1990a,
	Abstract = {The physical contrast of simple images such as sinusoidal gratings or a single patch of light on a uniform background is well defined and agrees with the perceived contrast, but this is not so for complex images. Most definitions assign a single contrast value to the whole image, but perceived contrast may vary greatly across the image. Human contrast sensitivity is a function of spatial frequency; therefore the spatial frequency content of an image should be considered in the definition of contrast. In this paper a definition of local band-limited contrast in images is proposed that assigns a contrast value to every point in the image as a function of the spatial frequency band. For each frequency band, the contrast is defined as the ratio of the bandpass-filtered image at the frequency to the low-pass image filtered to an octave below the same frequency (local luminance mean). This definition raises important implications regarding the perception of contrast in complex images and is helpful in understanding the effects of image-processing algorithms on the perceived contrast. A pyramidal image-contrast structure based on this definition is useful in simulating nonlinear, threshold characteristics of spatial vision in both normal observers and the visually impaired.},

	Abstract = {Great ape populations are undergoing a dramatic decline, which is predicted to result in their extinction in the wild from entire regions in the near future. Recent findings have particularly focused on African apes, and have implicated multiple factors contributing to this decline, such as deforestation, hunting, and disease. Less well-publicised, but equally dramatic, has been the decline in orang-utans, whose distribution is limited to parts of Sumatra and Borneo. Using the largest-ever genetic sample from wild orang-utan populations, we show strong evidence for a recent demographic collapse in North Eastern Borneo and demonstrate that this signature is independent of the mutation and demographic models used. This is the first demonstration that genetic data can detect and quantify the effect of recent, human-induced deforestation and habitat fragmentation on an endangered species. Because current demographic collapses are usually confounded by ancient events, this suggests a much more dramatic decline than demographic data alone and emphasises the need for major conservation efforts.},

	Abstract = {Humans use multiple sources of sensory information to estimate environmental properties. For example, the eyes and hands both provide relevant information about an object's shape. The eyes estimate shape using binocular disparity, perspective projection, etc. The hands supply haptic shape information by means of tactile and proprioceptive cues. Combining information across cues can improve estimation of object properties but may come at a cost: loss of single-cue information. We report that single-cue information is indeed lost when cues from within the same sensory modality (disparity and texture gradients in vision) are combined, but not when different modalities (vision and haptics) are combined.},

@article{rathelot2006a,
	Abstract = {How are the neurons that directly influence the motoneurons of a muscle distributed in the primary motor cortex (M1)? To answer this classical question we used retrograde transneuronal transport of rabies virus from single muscles of macaques. This enabled us to define cortico-motoneuronal (CM) cells that make monosynaptic connections with the motoneurons of the injected muscle. We examined the distribution of CM cells that project to motoneurons of three thumb and finger muscles. We found that the CM cells for these digit muscles are restricted to the caudal portion of M1, which is buried in the central sulcus. Within this region of M1, CM cells for one muscle display a remarkably widespread distribution and fill the entire mediolateral extent of the arm area. In fact, CM cells for digit muscles are found in regions of M1 that are known to contain the shoulder representation. The cortical territories occupied by CM cells for different muscles overlap extensively. Thus, we found no evidence for a focal representation of single muscles in M1. Instead, the overlap and intermingling among the different populations of CM cells may be the neural substrate to create a wide variety of muscle synergies. We found two additional surprising results. First, 15-16% of the CM cells originate from area 3a, a region of primary somatosensory cortex. Second, the size range of CM cells includes both "fast" and "slow" pyramidal tract neurons. These observations are likely to lead to dramatic changes in views about the function of the CM system.},

	Abstract = {The control of visuospatial attention entails multiple processes, including both voluntary (endogenous) factors and stimulus-driven (exogenous) factors. Exogenous processes can be triggered by visual targets presented at a previously unattended location, thus capturing attention in a stimulus-driven manner. However, little is known about the relative role of stimulus salience and behavioral relevance for this type of spatial reorienting. Here, we directly assessed how salience and relevance affect activation of the frontoparietal attentional system, using either low-salience but task-relevant target stimuli or salient but task-irrelevant flickering checkerboards. We compared event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging responses for stimuli presented at the unattended versus attended side (invalid minus valid trials), separately for the 2 categories of visual stimuli. We found that task-relevant invalid targets activated the frontoparietal attentional network, demonstrating that this system engages when target stimuli are presented at an unattended location, even when these have a low perceptual salience. Conversely, the presentation of high-salience checkerboards in one hemifield while endogenous attention was engaged elsewhere did not activate the attentional network. These findings indicate that task relevance is critical for stimulus-driven engagement of the attentional network when attentional resources are endogenously allocated somewhere else.},

@article{stewart2008a,
	Abstract = {Pitch patterns, such as melodies, consist of two levels of structure: a global level, comprising the pattern of ups and downs, or contour; and a local level, comprising the precise intervals that make up this contour. An influential neuropsychological model suggests that these two levels of processing are hierarchically linked, with processing of the global structure occurring within the right hemisphere in advance of local processing within the left. However, the predictions of this model and its anatomical basis have not been tested in neurologically normal individuals. The present study used fMRI and required participants to listen to consecutive pitch sequences while performing a same/different one-back task. Sequences, when different, either preserved (local) or violated (global) the contour of the sequence preceding them. When the activations for the local and global conditions were contrasted directly, additional activation was seen for local processing in right planum temporale and posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS). The presence of additional activation for local over global processing supports the hierarchical view that the global structure of a pitch sequence acts as a "framework" on which the local detail is subsequently hung. However, the lateralisation of activation seen in the present study, with global processing occurring in left pSTS and local processing occurring bilaterally, differed from that predicted by the neuroanatomical model. A re-examination of the individual lesion data on which the neuroanatomical model is based revealed that the lesion data equally well support the laterality scheme suggested by our data. While the present study supports the hierarchical view of local and global processing, there is an evident need for further research, both in patients and neurologically normal individuals, before an understanding of the functional lateralisation of local and global processing can be considered established.},

	Abstract = {Gamma band modulations in neural activity have been proposed to mediate attentional processes. To support a causal link between gamma activity and attentional selection, we attempt to evoke gamma oscillations by a 50-Hz subliminal flicker. We find that a subliminal 50-Hz flicker at a target location, before target presentation, speeds up and enhances target detection and discrimination. This effect is specific to the middle of the gamma range because it is not evident at <35-Hz flicker. It requires 300 ms to build up, dissipates within 250 ms of flicker offset, and shows a tendency to invert after 500 ms. The results are discussed in relation to a role for gamma band neural synchrony in the allocation of visual attention.},

	Abstract = {We have studied the effects of contrast adaptation on cortical cells from 4- and 6-wk-old kittens (49 and 47 cells, respectively) using sine-wave grating stimuli. We wished to know if the effects of adaptation to different contrast levels are more extensive than those in adult animals. Our experiments involved adapting cells to different contrasts (3.1, 12.5, and 50%) while concurrently measuring their contrast-response functions at each of these different levels. We found qualitatively that the effects of adaptation in the kitten are similar to those we have previously documented in adult animals (19). Contrast-response functions are laterally shifted along the log-contrast axis, effectively matching the response range of the cells to prevailing contrast levels. The degree to which this occurred varied from cell to cell. The average degree to which cells showed these effects, as assessed both qualitatively and quantitatively, was greater for kittens than for adult cats, and greater for 4-wk-old kittens than for those aged 6 wk. This suggests that susceptibility to adaptation varies as a function of age. Additional studies were undertaken with the intent of localizing these adaptive effects. First, lateral geniculate cells and fibers (n = 23) were studied with our standard protocol, and second, we investigated the degree to which the effects of adaptation of cortical cells transferred interocularly.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

	Abstract = {Nutrition and nutritional status can have profound effects on immune functions, resistance to infection and autoimmunity in man and other animals. Nutrients enhance or depress immune function depending on the nutrient and level of its intake. Protein-energy malnutrition and vitamin A deficiency are strongly associated with impaired immunity and infectious disease. The essential role vitamin A plays in infection and maintenance of mucosal surfaces has long been known. Recent evidence shows that T-cell subpopulations, cytokines and antibody subclasses are all affected by vitamin A. In animal studies supplementation with vitamin E protects against infection and is linked to stimulatory effects on the immune system. In man vitamin E and other anti-oxidants increase the number of CD4+ cells. Dietary lipids and zinc have a substantial impact on autoimmunity from protective to potentiation of immuno-pathological processes in animals. There is considerable potential to modify human autoimmune disease by manipulation of lipid nutrition. Deficiency of pyridoxine induces atrophy of lymphoid organs, marked reduction in lymphocyte numbers, impairs antibody responses and IL-2 production. Dietary copper is important in the prevention of infection in some animal species and T-cell function is defective under deficiency states due to an inability to produce IL-2. Selenium has been linked to viral infection, enhanced T-cell functions and TNF beta induced increase in natural killer cell activity. Understanding the molecular and cellular immunological mechanisms involved in nutrient-immune interactions will increase our applications for nutrition of the immune system in health and in disease},

	Abstract = {Recent evidence indicates that stimulus-driven and goal-directed control of visual selection operate independently and in different time windows (van Zoest et al., 2004). The present study further investigates how eye movements are affected by stimulus-driven and goal-directed control. Observers were presented with search displays consisting of one target, multiple non-targets and one distractor element. The task of observers was to make a fast eye movement to a target immediately following the offset of a central fixation point, an event that either co-occurred with or soon followed the presentation of the search display. Distractor saliency and target-distractor similarity were independently manipulated. The results demonstrated that the effect of distractor saliency was transient and only present for the fastest eye movements, whereas the effect of target-distractor similarity was sustained and present in all but the fastest eye movements. The results support an independent timing account of visual selection.},

	Abstract = {In both the vertebrate nose and the insect antenna, most olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) respond to multiple odors. However, some ORNs respond to just a single odor, or at most to a few highly related odors. It has been hypothesized that narrowly tuned ORNs project to narrowly tuned neurons in the brain, and that these dedicated circuits mediate innate behavioral responses to a particular ligand. Here we have investigated neural activity and behavior downstream from two narrowly tuned ORN types in Drosophila melanogaster. We found that genetically ablating either of these ORN types impairs innate behavioral attraction to their cognate ligand. Neurons in the antennal lobe postsynaptic to one of these ORN types are, like their presynaptic ORNs, narrowly tuned to a pheromone. However, neurons postsynaptic to the second ORN type are broadly tuned. These results demonstrate that some narrowly tuned ORNs project to dedicated central circuits, ensuring a tight connection between stimulus and behavior, whereas others project to central neurons that participate in the ensemble representations of many odors.},

	Abstract = {The emergence of functional lateral interactions in ferret visual cortex was monitored using high speed optical imaging of voltage-sensitive dye signals in brain slices. Prior to the time of eye opening, lateral activation was restricted to a narrow columnar region. During the week following eye opening, the extent of lateral propagation of activity more than doubled. Selective interruption of specific pathways in the slice, combined with pharmacological and anatomical experiments, determined that this lateral propagation was mediated by horizontal projections made within layer 2/3. These results indicate that functional horizontal interactions emerge only after axons begin branching and in parallel with, but not prior to, the refinement of orientation selectivity.},

@article{mannan1997b,
	Abstract = {Eye movements made by eighteen observers in response to brief (3 s) presentations of eleven different images, each in three forms (unfiltered, high-pass filtered and low-pass filtered), have been analysed in order to identify both repeated sequences of fixations and image locations which attract re-fixations. It is shown that eye-movement traces made by different observers in response to the same image have few common temporal sequences involving the same fixation locations, even for sequences of only two fixations. There is a greater incidence of such sequences in eye-movement traces made by the same observer in response to two presentations of the same image, but average numbers are still low. Conserved sequences involving more than two identical locations occur at a much lower frequency, and the incidence of repeated sequences is not increased if consideration is restricted to regions of the image which attract large numbers of fixations. It is concluded that the temporal sequence in which fixations are made is not a significant factor in the analysis of the eye-movement data considered in this report. Calculations based on a least squares index of similarity are consistent with this conclusion. The analysis shows a relatively high incidence of re-fixation on certain locations in the images and there is evidence that such re-fixations are a significant factor in the high similarity between fixation locations established by different observers when viewing the same image.},

	Abstract = {Graves' disease, the most common cause of hyperthyroidism, is an autoimmune disorder. Antithyroid drugs have been selected as the first-line treatment of Graves' disease in Korea, Japan, and European countries. However, antithyroid drugs such as methimazole (MMI) and prophylthiouracil (PTU) have limitations in clinical applications because of their side effects. In this study, we performed a clinical trial and in vitro study to investigate the clinical effects and action mechanism of Ahnjeonbaekho-tang (AJBHT), an herbal remedy for Graves' disease. In a clinical study of Graves' disease patients who had side effects from antithyroid drugs, we found that treatment by AJBHT resulted in a reduction of serum triiodothyronine (T3) and free thyroxine (FT4) levels and an increase in thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels (T3: p<0.0001, FT4: p=0.0012, TSH: p=0.0370, respectively). In vitro, AJBHT significantly inhibits FRTL-5 cell proliferation, DNA synthesis, cyclic AMP production, T4 synthesis, and the expression of thyroglobulin (Tg) mRNA in comparison with the control. These results suggest that AJBHT might suppress T(4) synthesis by modulating adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) and Tg expression, and therefore, AJBHT could be an alternative therapy for Graves' disease patients who have side effects from antithyroid drugs.},

	Abstract = {Previously encountered stimuli can bring to mind a vivid memory of the episodic context in which the stimulus was first experienced ("remembered" stimuli), or can simply seem familiar ("known" stimuli). Past studies suggest that more attentional resources are required to encode stimuli that are subsequently remembered than known. However, it is unclear if the attentional resources are distributed differently during encoding and recognition of remembered and known stimuli. Here, we record eye movements while participants encode photos, and later while indicating whether the photos are remembered, known or new. Eye fixations were more clustered during both encoding and recognition of remembered photos relative to known photos. Thus, recognition of photos that bring to mind a vivid memory for the episodic context in which they were experienced is associated with less distributed overt attention during encoding and recognition. The results suggest that remembering is related to encoding of a few distinct details of a photo rather than the photo as a whole. In turn, during recognition remembering may be trigged by enhanced memory for the salient details of the photos.},

	Abstract = {Simple perceptual tasks have laid the groundwork for understanding the neurobiology of decision-making. Here, we examined this foundation to explain how decision-making circuitry adjusts in the face of a more difficult task. We measured behavioral and physiological responses of monkeys on a two- and four-choice direction-discrimination decision task. For both tasks, firing rates in the lateral intraparietal area appeared to reflect the accumulation of evidence for or against each choice. Evidence accumulation began at a lower firing rate for the four-choice task, but reached a common level by the end of the decision process. The larger excursion suggests that the subjects required more evidence before making a choice. Furthermore, on both tasks, we observed a time-dependent rise in firing rates that may impose a deadline for deciding. These physiological observations constitute an effective strategy for handling increased task difficulty. The differences appear to explain subjects' accuracy and reaction times.},

	Abstract = {The present study combined exogenous spatial cueing with masked repetition priming to study attentional influences on the processing of subliminal stimuli. Participants performed an alphabetic decision task (letter versus pseudo-letter classification) with central targets and briefly presented peripherally located primes that were either cued or not cued by an abrupt onset. A relatively long delay between cue and prime was used to investigate the effect of inhibition of return (IOR) on the processing of subliminal masked primes. Primes presented to the left visual field showed standard effects of Cue Validity and no IOR (significant priming with valid cues only). Primes presented to the right visual field showed no priming from valid cues (an IOR effect), and priming with invalid cues that depended on hand of response to letter targets (right-hand in Experiment 1, left-hand in Experiment 2). The results are interpreted in terms of a differential speed of engagement and disengagement of attention to the right and left visual fields for alphabetic stimuli, coupled with a complex interaction that arises between Prime Relatedness and response-hand.},

The order of neurogenesis was found to be highly conserved across a wide range of mammals and to correlate with the relative enlargement of structures as brain size increases, with disproportionately large growth occurring in late-generated structures. Because the order of neurogenesis is conserved, the most likely brain alteration resulting from selection for any behavioral ability may be a coordinated enlargement of the entire nonolfactory brain.},

	Abstract = {In a natural setting, adaptive mechanisms constantly modulate the encoding properties of sensory neurons in response to changes in the external environment. Recent experiments have revealed that adaptation affects both the spatiotemporal integration properties and baseline membrane potential of sensory neurons. However, the precise functional role of adaptation remains an open question, due in part to contradictory experimental results. Here, we develop a framework to characterize adaptive encoding, including a cascade model with a time-varying receptive field (reflecting spatiotemporal integration properties) and offset (reflecting baseline membrane potential), and a recursive technique for tracking changes in the model parameters during a single stimulus/response trial. Simulated and experimental responses from retinal neurons are used to track adaptive changes in receptive field structure and offset during nonstationary stimulation. Due to the nonlinear nature of spiking neurons, the parameters of the receptive field and offset must be estimated simultaneously, or changes in the offset (or even in the statistical distribution of the stimulus) can mask, confound, or create the illusion of adaptive changes in the receptive field. Our analysis suggests that these confounding effects may be at the root of the inconsistency in the literature and shows that seemingly conflicting experimental results can be reconciled within our framework.},

@article{gutnisky2008a,
	Abstract = {Our perception of the environment relies on the capacity of neural networks to adapt rapidly to changes in incoming stimuli. It is increasingly being realized that the neural code is adaptive, that is, sensory neurons change their responses and selectivity in a dynamic manner to match the changes in input stimuli. Understanding how rapid exposure, or adaptation, to a stimulus of fixed structure changes information processing by cortical networks is essential for understanding the relationship between sensory coding and behaviour. Physiological investigations of adaptation have contributed greatly to our understanding of how individual sensory neurons change their responses to influence stimulus coding, yet whether and how adaptation affects information coding in neural populations is unknown. Here we examine how brief adaptation (on the timescale of visual fixation) influences the structure of interneuronal correlations and the accuracy of population coding in the macaque (Macaca mulatta) primary visual cortex (V1). We find that brief adaptation to a stimulus of fixed structure reorganizes the distribution of correlations across the entire network by selectively reducing their mean and variability. The post-adaptation changes in neuronal correlations are associated with specific, stimulus-dependent changes in the efficiency of the population code, and are consistent with changes in perceptual performance after adaptation. Our results have implications beyond the predictions of current theories of sensory coding, suggesting that brief adaptation improves the accuracy of population coding to optimize neuronal performance during natural viewing.},

	Abstract = {A model that fully describes the response properties of visual neurons must be able to predict their activity during natural vision. While many models have been proposed for the visual system, few have ever been tested against this criterion. To address this issue, we have developed a general framework for fitting and validating nonlinear models of visual neurons using natural visual stimuli. Our approach derives from linear spatiotemporal receptive field (STRF) analysis, which has frequently been used to study the visual system. However, prior to the linear filtering stage typical of STRFs, a linearizing transformation is applied to the stimulus to account for nonlinear response properties. We used this approach to compare two models for neurons in primary visual cortex: a nonlinear Fourier power model, which accounts for spatial phase invariant tuning, and a traditional linear model. We characterized prediction accuracy in terms of the total explainable variance, given intrinsic experimental noise. On average, Fourier power STRFs predicted 40% of explainable variance while linear STRFs were able to predict only 21% of explainable variance. The performance of the Fourier power model provides a benchmark for evaluating more sophisticated models in the future.},

	Abstract = {When a monkey searches for a colour and orientation feature conjunction target, the scan path is guided to target coloured locations in preference to locations containing the target orientation [Vision Res. 38 (1998b) 1805]. An active vision model, using biased competition, is able to replicate this behaviour. As object-based attention develops in extrastriate cortex, featural information is passed to posterior parietal cortex (LIP), enabling it to represent behaviourally relevant locations [J. Neurophysiol. 76 (1996) 2841] and guide the scan path. Attention evolves from an early spatial effect to being object-based later in the response of the model neurons, as has been observed in monkey single cell recordings. This is the first model to reproduce these effects with temporal precision and is reported here at the systems level allowing the replication of psychophysical scan paths.},

	Abstract = {Visual search is aided by previous knowledge regarding distinguishing features and probable locations of a sought-after target. However, how the human brain represents and integrates concurrent feature-based and spatial expectancies to guide visual search is currently not well understood. Specifically, it is not clear whether spatial and feature-based search information is initially represented in anatomically segregated regions, nor at which level of processing expectancies regarding target features and locations may be integrated. To address these questions, we independently and parametrically varied the degree of spatial and feature-based (color) cue information concerning the identity of an upcoming visual search target while recording blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) responses in human subjects. Search performance improved with the amount of spatial and feature-based cue information, and cue-related BOLD responses showed that, during preparation for visual search, spatial and feature cue information were represented additively in shared frontal, parietal, and cingulate regions. These data show that representations of spatial and feature-based search information are integrated in source regions of top-down biasing and oculomotor planning before search onset. The purpose of this anticipatory integration could lie with the generation of a "top-down salience map," a search template of primed target locations and features. Our results show that this role may be served by the intraparietal sulcus, which additively integrated a spatially specific activation gain in relation to spatial cue information with a spatially global activation gain in relation to feature cue information.},

	Abstract = {Neurons display a variety of complex dendritic morphologies even within the same class. We examined the relationship between dendritic arborization and the coupling between somatic and dendritic action potential (AP) initiation sites in layer 5 (L5) neocortical pyramidal neurons. Coupling was defined as the relative reduction in threshold for initiation of a dendritic calcium AP due to a coincident back-propagating AP. Simulations based on reconstructions of biocytin-filled cells showed that addition of oblique branches of the main apical dendrite in close proximity to the soma (d < 140 microm) increases the coupling between the apical and axosomatic AP initiation zones, whereas incorporation of distal branches decreases coupling. Experimental studies on L5 pyramids in acute brain slices revealed a highly significant (n = 28, r = 0.63, P < 0.0005) correlation: increasing the fraction of proximal oblique dendrites (d < 140 microm), e.g., from 30 to 60% resulted on average in an increase of the coupling from approximately 35% to almost 60%. We conclude that variation in dendritic arborization may be a key determinant of variability in coupling (49 +/- 17%; range 19-83%; n = 37) and is likely to outweigh the contribution made by variations in active membrane properties. Thus coincidence detection of inputs arriving from different cortical layers is strongly regulated by differences in dendritic arborization.},

	Annote = {Here we focused on variations of the dendritic branching pattern within one class of cells, thick tufted neocortical layer 5 (L5) pyramidal neurons. This cell type is one of the largest  found in the mammalian cortex. 


Its prominent apical dendrite extends vertically 􏴋1.3 mm from the soma and gives rise to a tuft of dendritic branches in layer 1 and oblique dendrites spreading horizontally in layers 2/3 and 4.

2 different regenerative events:
1/Sodium based AP generated at the soma level which propagates back to dendrites bAP
2/long lasting Ca AP, generated in the distant apical dendrites which can be evoked by distal strong synaptic input

1 can lower the threshold for 2 ==> BAC firing (back propagation activated calcium spike firing)

they conclude that the geometrical variation in the apical dendrites, especially the branch position, influence the degree of coupling between 1 and 2 in such a way that it might outweight the contribution of different active membrane properties.},

@article{peters1994a,
	Abstract = {Using data that are available in various publications, a quantitative analysis has been made of the geniculocortical input to layer IVC of the macaque striate cortex. The data suggest that only 1.3-1.9% of the excitatory, or asymmetric synapses in layer IVC alpha of striate cortex are provided by the neurons of the magnocellular layers of the LGN. This amounts to only 18-40 of the 1000-2100 asymmetric synapses that the average layer IVC alpha neuron receives. The parvicellular afferents to layer IVC beta, on the other hand, provide 3.7-8.7% of the asymmetric synapses formed by the average layer IVC beta neuron, or 37-191 synapses to each neuron. If it is assumed that the boutons in the geniculocortical axonal plexuses are evenly spread, it can be calculated that the input to an individual layer IVC neuron is provided by some 24 axonal plexuses. This is regardless of whether the neuron lies in layer IVC alpha or in IVC beta. This calculation suggests that a single axonal plexus provides not more than one or two of the excitatory synapses received by an individual layer IVC alpha neuron, and between one and eight excitatory synapses for a layer IVC beta neuron. Consequently, it is unlikely that the response properties of a particular cortical neuron are dominated by its input from a single geniculate neuron. Since the geniculocortical input essentially determines the response properties of neurons in layer IV of macaque striate cortex, it is surprising that this input amounts to such a small number of synapses to an individual neuron, although we obtained a somewhat similar result in our earlier quantitative analysis of the geniculate input to the striate cortex of the cat (Peters and Payne, 1993). But it has to be questioned whether the low values obtained are correct. Interestingly, the geniculocortical input to cortex has been largely neglected in favor of analyses of intracortical circuitry, but in view of the basic importance of this afferent input, it is suggested that more quantitative data about it should be generated, so that a better assessment can be made of its extent.},

	Abstract = {A single visual stimulus activates neurons in many different cortical areas. A major challenge in cortical physiology is to understand how the neural activity in these numerous active zones leads to a unified percept of the visual scene. The anatomical basis for these interactions is the dense network of connections that link the visual areas. Within this network, feedforward connections transmit signals from lower-order areas such as V1 or V2 to higher-order areas. In addition, there is a dense web of feedback connections which, despite their anatomical prominence, remain functionally mysterious. Here we show, using reversible inactivation of a higher-order area (monkey area V5/MT), that feedback connections serve to amplify and focus activity of neurons in lower-order areas, and that they are important in the differentiation of figure from ground, particularly in the case of stimuli of low visibility. More specifically, we show that feedback connections facilitate responses to objects moving within the classical receptive field; enhance suppression evoked by background stimuli in the surrounding region; and have the strongest effects for stimuli of low salience.},

	Abstract = {Here we describe several fundamental principles of olfactory processing in the Drosophila melanogaster antennal lobe (the analog of the vertebrate olfactory bulb), through the systematic analysis of input and output spike trains of seven identified glomeruli. Repeated presentations of the same odor elicit more reproducible responses in second-order projection neurons (PNs) than in their presynaptic olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). PN responses rise and accommodate rapidly, emphasizing odor onset. Furthermore, weak ORN inputs are amplified in the PN layer but strong inputs are not. This nonlinear transformation broadens PN tuning and produces more uniform distances between odor representations in PN coding space. In addition, portions of the odor response profile of a PN are not systematically related to their direct ORN inputs, which probably indicates the presence of lateral connections between glomeruli. Finally, we show that a linear discriminator classifies odors more accurately using PN spike trains than using an equivalent number of ORN spike trains.},

	Abstract = {What distinguishes the locations that we fixate from those that we do not? To answer this question we recorded eye movements while observers viewed natural scenes, and recorded image characteristics centred at the locations that observers fixated. To investigate potential differences in the visual characteristics of fixated versus non-fixated locations, these images were transformed to make intensity, contrast, colour, and edge content explicit. Signal detection and information theoretic techniques were then used to compare fixated regions to those that were not. The presence of contrast and edge information was more strongly discriminatory than luminance or chromaticity. Fixated locations tended to be more distinctive in the high spatial frequencies. Extremes of low frequency luminance information were avoided. With prolonged viewing, consistency in fixation locations between observers decreased. In contrast to [Parkhurst, D. J., Law, K., {\&} Niebur, E. (2002). Modeling the role of salience in the allocation of overt visual attention. Vision Research, 42 (1), 107-123] we found no change in the involvement of image features over time. We attribute this difference in our results to a systematic bias in their metric. We propose that saccade target selection involves an unchanging intermediate level representation of the scene but that the high-level interpretation of this representation changes over time.},

	Abstract = {The temporal development of neural selectivity to physical attributes of a visual stimulus, such as its orientation and spatial frequency, can provide important clues about mechanisms of cortical tuning. We measured the dynamics of orientation tuning in macaque primary visual cortex (V1) and found several dynamical features in the data: changes in global enhancement and suppression, narrowing of orientation bandwidth, small but significant shifts in preferred orientation, and "Mexican-hat" tuning curves. The dynamics data were analyzed with a model that sums two fixed, tuned components (enhancement and suppression) and one global (untuned) component. The analysis suggests that there is early global enhancement followed by global and tuned suppression. Tuned suppression accounts for the dynamical reduction of orientation bandwidth and for the generation of Mexican-hat tuning profiles. Our findings imply that global and tuned suppression are important factors that determine the selectivity and dynamics of V1 responses to orientation.},

	Abstract = {Although many animals use the Earth's magnetic field for orientation and navigation, the precise biophysical mechanisms underlying magnetic sensing have been elusive. One theoretical model proposes that geomagnetic fields are perceived by chemical reactions involving specialized photoreceptors. However, the specific photoreceptor involved in such magnetoreception has not been demonstrated conclusively in any animal. Here we show that the ultraviolet-A/blue-light photoreceptor cryptochrome (Cry) is necessary for light-dependent magnetosensitive responses in Drosophila melanogaster. In a binary-choice behavioural assay for magnetosensitivity, wild-type flies show significant naive and trained responses to a magnetic field under full-spectrum light ( approximately 300-700 nm) but do not respond to the field when wavelengths in the Cry-sensitive, ultraviolet-A/blue-light part of the spectrum (<420 nm) are blocked. Notably, Cry-deficient cry(0) and cry(b) flies do not show either naive or trained responses to a magnetic field under full-spectrum light. Moreover, Cry-dependent magnetosensitivity does not require a functioning circadian clock. Our work provides, to our knowledge, the first genetic evidence for a Cry-based magnetosensitive system in any animal.},

	Abstract = {The thyroid gland of children is especially vulnerable to the carcinogenic action of ionizing radiation. To provide insights into various modifying influences on risk, seven major studies with organ doses to individual subjects were evaluated. Five cohort studies (atomic bomb survivors, children treated for tinea capitis, two studies of children irradiated for enlarged tonsils, and infants irradiated for an enlarged thymus gland) and two case-control studies (patients with cervical cancer and childhood cancer) were studied. The combined studies include almost 120,000 people (approximately 58,000 exposed to a wide range of doses and 61,000 nonexposed subjects), nearly 700 thyroid cancers and 3,000,000 person years of follow-up. For persons exposed to radiation before age 15 years, linearity best described the dose response, even down to 0.10 Gy. At the highest doses (> 10 Gy), associated with cancer therapy, there appeared to be a decrease or leveling of risk. For childhood exposures, the pooled excess relative risk per Gy (ERR/Gy) was 7.7 (95% CI = 2.1, 28.7) and the excess absolute risk per 10(4) PY Gy (EAR/10(4) PY Gy) was 4.4 (95% CI = 1.9, 10.1). The attributable risk percent (AR%) at 1 Gy was 88%. However, these summary estimates were affected strongly by age at exposure even within this limited age range. The ERR was greater (P = 0.07) for females than males, but the findings from the individual studies were not consistent. The EAR was higher among women, reflecting their higher rate of naturally occurring thyroid cancer. The distribution of ERR over time followed neither a simple multiplicative nor an additive pattern in relation to background occurrence. Only two cases were seen within 5 years of exposure. The ERR began to decline about 30 years after exposure but was still elevated at 40 years. Risk also decreased significantly with increasing age at exposure, with little risk apparent after age 20 years. Based on limited data, there was a suggestion that spreading dose over time (from a few days to > 1 year) may lower risk, possibly due to the opportunity for cellular repair mechanisms to operate. The thyroid gland in children has one of the highest risk coefficients of any organ and is the only tissue with convincing evidence for risk about 1.10 Gy.},

	Abstract = {The receptive field of a visual neuron is classically defined as the region of space (or retina) where a visual stimulus evokes a change in its firing activity. At the cortical level, a challenging issue concerns the roles of feedforward, local recurrent, intracortical, and cortico-cortical feedback connectivity in receptive field properties. Intracellular recordings in cat area 17 showed that the visually evoked synaptic integration field extends over a much larger area than that established on the basis of spike activity. Synaptic depolarizing responses to stimuli flashed at increasing distances from the center of the receptive field decreased in strength, whereas their onset latency increased. These findings suggest that subthreshold responses in the unresponsive region surrounding the classical discharge field result from the integration of visual activation waves spread by slowly conducting horizontal axons within primary visual cortex.},

The central concerns are whether the models prescribe maximally efficient (optimal) integration and to what extent the models are psychologically valid. Evaluation, integration, and decision processes are specified for each model. Important features are whether evaluation is noisy, whether integration follows Bayes's theorem, and whether decision consists of a criterion rule or a relative goodness rule. Simulations of the models and predictions of the results by the same models are carried out to provide a measure of identifiability or the extent to which the models can be distinguished from one another. The models are also contrasted against empirical results from tasks with 2 and 4 response alternatives and with graded responses.},

	Abstract = {Chronic recording of locus coeruleus (LC) neurons in rat and monkey have pointed out that brief, phasic LC discharges, but not sustained activity, are specifically related to salient stimuli and attention. However, the sensory consequences of phasic activation of the noradrenergic system by a brief conditioning stimulation of the LC have not been fully investigated. This study examined the effect of LC activation on synaptic and neuronal responses to a tactile stimulus in the sensorimotor cortex of the anaesthetized rat, by analysing the fine temporal structure of sensory discharges and current source-density profiles recorded from the same electrodes. LC stimulation, with minimal EEG effects, consistently reduced the synaptic input in layers IV and V-VI, by decreasing the amplitude and duration of short-latency current sinks, but not the slope of their early rising phase. Simultaneously, most multiple and single unit excitatory responses were shortened by the suppression of their late component after 25-30 ms, whereas robust temporal facilitation of the early discharge was found for spike latency mean and variance, spike timing and synchronization to the stimulus, but leaving the number of spikes unaffected. These two apparently opposite effects on the synaptic drive and neuronal response are reminiscent of the noradrenergic depression of afferent synaptic potentials observed with an increased neuronal excitability in vitro. They are interpreted as a noradrenergic sharpening of thalamocortical processing consistent with a presumed role of synchronous discharges in perception that would depend on activated states, particularly when LC activity is correlated with vigilance or attention.},

@article{laaris2007a,
	Abstract = {Main olfactory bulb (MOB) granule cells receive spatially segregated glutamatergic synaptic inputs from the dendrites of mitral/tufted cells as well as from the axons of centrifugal fibers (CFFs) originating in olfactory cortical areas. Dendrodendritic synapses from mitral/tufted cells occur on granule cell distal dendrites in the external plexiform layer (EPL), whereas CFFs preferentially target the somata/proximal dendrites of granule cells in the granule cell layer (GCL). In the present study, tract tracing, and recordings of field potentials and voltage-sensitive dye optical signals were used to map activity patterns elicited by activation of these two inputs to granule cells in mouse olfactory bulb slices. Stimulation of the lateral olfactory tract (LOT) produced a negative field potential in the EPL and a positivity in the GCL. CFF stimulation produced field potentials of opposite polarity in the EPL and GCL to those elicited by LOT. LOT-evoked optical signals appeared in the EPL and spread subsequently to deeper layers, whereas CFF-evoked responses appeared in the GCL and then spread superficially. Evoked responses were reduced by N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists and completely suppressed by AMPA receptor antagonists. Reduction of extracellular Mg(2+) enhanced the strength and spatiotemporal extent of the evoked responses. These and additional findings indicate that LOT- and CFF-evoked field potentials and optical signals reflect postsynaptic activity in granule cells, with moderate NMDA and dominant AMPA receptor components. Taken together, these results demonstrate that LOT and CFF stimulation in MOB slices selectively activate glutamatergic inputs to the distal dendrites versus somata/proximal dendrites of granule cells.},

@article{liu2006a,
	Abstract = {Low-frequency electrical signals like those that compose the local field potential (LFP) can be detected at substantial distances from their point of origin within the brain. It is thus unclear how useful the LFP might be for assessing local function, for example, on the spatial scale of cortical columns. We addressed this problem by comparing speed and direction tuning of LFPs obtained from middle temporal area MT with the tuning of multiunit (MU) activity recorded simultaneously. We found that the LFP can be well tuned for speed and direction and is highly correlated with that of MU activity, particularly for frequencies at and above the gamma band. LFP tuning is substantially poorer for lower frequencies, although tuning for direction extends to lower frequencies than does tuning for speed. Our data suggest that LFP signals at and above the gamma band reflect neural processing on the spatial scale of cortical columns, within a few hundred micrometers of the electrode tip. Consistent with this notion, we also found that frequencies at and above the gamma band measured during a speed discrimination task exhibit an effect known as "choice probability," which reveals a particularly close relationship between neural activity and behavioral choices. In the LFP, this signature of the perceptual choice comprises a shift in relative power from low-frequency bands (alpha and beta) to the gamma band. It remains to be determined how LFP choice probability, which is a temporal signature, is related to conventional choice probability effects observed in spike rates.},

	Abstract = {Strabismus (or squint) is both a well-established model for developmental plasticity and a frequent clinical symptom. To analyze experience-dependent plasticity of functional maps in the brain we used optical imaging of intrinsic signals to visualize both orientation and ocular dominance domains in cat area 18. In strabismic animals, iso-orientation domains exhibited a pinwheel-like organization, as previously described for area 18 of normally raised animals and for area 17 of both normally raised and strabismic cats. In area 18, mean pinwheel density was similar in the experimental (2.2 pinwheel centers per mm2 cortical surface) and control animals (2.3/mm2 in normally raised animals), but significantly lower than in area 17 of both normally raised and strabismic cats (2.7-3.4/mm2). A comparison of orientation and ocular dominance domains revealed that iso-orientation domains were continuous across the borders of ocular dominance domains and tended to cross these borders at steep angles. Thus, the orientation map does not seem to be modified by experience-dependent changes in afferent activity. Together with our recent observation that strabismus does not enhance the segregation of ocular dominance domains in cat area 18, the present data indicate that the layout of functional maps in area 18 is less susceptible to experience-dependent manipulations than in area 17.},

	Abstract = {It has not been possible to analyze the cellular mechanisms underlying learning in behaving mammals because of the difficulties in recording intracellularly from awake animals. Therefore, in the present study of neuronal plasticity in behaving monkeys, the net effect of a single neuron on another neuron (the "functional connection") was evaluated by cross-correlating the times of firing of the two neurons. When two neurons were induced to fire together within a short time window, the functional connection between them was potentiated, and when simultaneous firing was prevented, the connection was depressed. These modifications were strongly dependent on the behavioral context of the stimuli that induced them. The results indicate that changes in the temporal contingency between neurons are often necessary, but not sufficient, for cortical plasticity in the adult monkey: behavioral relevance is required.},

"Any form of selectivity implies that neurons will show a degree of sparseness in the natural environment, since selectivity by definition means neurons respond only to a portion of the possible environmental stimuli."

" For a neuron with a full response and refractory time of 5 msec, the maximal firing rate would be 200 Hz. A system that is providing a maximal information rate would fire at approximately half the time, i.e. at 100 Hz. Although neurons may reach such rates, neurons do not maintain these rates for more than brief periods. "

why?
becoz:

"With a limit on the range of possible firing rates, the maximum information 
transfer occurs when all states of the channel are used with equal frequency---a flat distribution of firing rates."


"If the bound on a distribution is instead the variance of the responses (rather than the range of responses), the distribution with the greatest information rate (greatest entropy) is a 
Gaussian. The visual system appears to follow neither of these models. A sparse code means that neural firing rates will show a highly peaked, non-Gaussian distribution; i.e., one that does not produce maximum information transfer. Moreover, as sparseness increases, the information rate drops. Why might this be a good idea?"

so this is the same question stated in the first paragraph. why do neurons not use the maximum information rate in their spiking behavior? but in the same time, if a neuron would be using all firing rates with the same frequency then that neuron wouldnt really be selective. So as a result: 

"as sparseness increases, the information rate drops [but the effectiveness increase] . Why might this be a good idea? " 


"Natural Images are constrained by strong correlations between neighboring regions, and image discontinuities are usually defined by edges. This predictability implies that a high information rate is simply unnecessary."


so a code which has the lowest information rate is the code which is most sparse and effective.

they argue that sparseness might arise due to metabolic demands rather than representational demands. However given that responses to gaussian noise exhibit non-gaussian responses, this might be a sign that cellular mechanism play a key role in the sparseness of the responses.

	Abstract = {The composition of a visual scene influences the ability of humans to select specific details within that scene for discrimination or foveation with saccadic eye movements. With the goal of establishing an animal model to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying the deployment of visual attention and the guidance of saccades during visual search, we studied the visual behavior of three monkeys while they performed a conjunction (color + form) search task similar to those used in human studies. We found that search performance declined when distractors adjacent to the target shared its color, thereby revealing that color was more discriminable than form in these displays and suggesting that monkeys perceptually grouped stimuli by proximity and similarity. Search performance also varied with the overall composition of the display. Most importantly, saccades were biased toward distractors sharing the target color when there were few of them within the display and away from those distractors when they were numerous. Last, the monkeys initiated saccades with a fixed latency, suggesting that their responses to the display were automatic and that search strategies did not involve attentional resources beyond those recruited for regulating saccades. We conclude that monkeys adapt their visual strategies, largely via bottom-up processes, to both the local and the global context of the search. These findings suggest that the visual behavior of monkeys is guided by strategies similar to those observed in humans.},

	Abstract = {The Whorf hypothesis holds that differences between languages induce differences in perception and/or cognition in their speakers. Much of the experimental work pursuing this idea has focused on the domain of color and has centered on the issue of whether linguistically coded color categories influence color discrimination. A new perspective has been cast on the debate by recent results that suggest that language influences color discrimination strongly in the right visual field but not in the left visual field (LVF). This asymmetry is likely related to the contralateral projection of visual fields to cerebral hemispheres and the specialization of the left hemisphere for language. The current study presents three independent experiments that replicate and extend these earlier results by using different tasks and testing across different color category boundaries. Our results differ in one respect: although we find that Whorfian effects on color are stronger for stimuli in the right visual field than in the LVF, we find that there are significant category effects in the LVF as well. The origin of the significant category effect in the LVF is considered, and two factors that might account for the pattern of results are proposed.},

	Abstract = {We present a new technique called "t-SNE" that visualizes high-dimensional data by giving each datapoint a location in a two or three-dimensional map. The technique is a variation of Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002) that is much easier to optimize, and produces significantly better visualizations by reducing the tendency to crowd points together in the center of the map. t-SNE is better than existing techniques at creating a single map that reveals structure at many different scales. This is particularly important for high-dimensional data that lie on several different, but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as images ofobjects from multiple classes seen from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure of very large data sets, we show how t-SNE can use random walks on neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the data to influence the way in which a subset of the data is displayed. We illustrate the performance of t-SNE on a wide variety of data sets and compare it with many other non-parametric visualization techniques, including Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding. The visualizations produced by t-SNE are significantly better than those produced by the other techniques on almost all of the data sets.},

We have investigated and developed a methodology that serves to automatically identify such a subset of aROIs (algorithmically detected ROIs) using different image processing algorithms (IPAs), and appropriate clustering procedures. In human perception, an internal representation directs top-down, context-dependent sequences of eye movements to fixate on similar sequences of hROIs (human identified ROIs). In the paper, we introduce our methodology and we compare aROIs with hROIs as a criterion for evaluating and selecting bottom-up, context-free algorithms. An application is finally discussed},

	Abstract = {Stereoscopic depth perception relies on binocular disparities, or small geometric differences between the retinal images of each eye. The most reliable binocular depth judgments are those that are based on relative disparities between two simultaneously visible features in a scene. Many cortical areas contain neurons that are sensitive to disparity, but it is unclear whether any areas show a specific sensitivity to relative disparity. We recorded from neurons in the early cortical visual area V2 of the awake macaque during presentation of random-dot patterns. The depth of a central region ('center'), and that of an annular surrounding region ('surround'), were manipulated independently in these stimuli. Some cells were fully selective for the resulting relative disparities. Most showed partial selectivity, which nonetheless indicated a sensitivity for the depth relationship between center and surround. Both types of neural response could support psychophysical judgments of relative depth.},

	Abstract = {The firing rate responses of neurons in the primary visual cortex grow with stimulus contrast, the variation in the luminance of an image relative to the mean luminance. These responses, however, are reduced after a cell is exposed for prolonged periods to high-contrast visual stimuli. This phenomenon, known as contrast adaptation, occurs in the cortex and is not present at earlier stages of visual processing. To investigate the cellular mechanisms underlying cortical adaptation, intracellular recordings were performed in the visual cortex of cats, and the effects of prolonged visual stimulation were studied. Surprisingly, contrast adaptation barely affected the stimulus-driven modulations in the membrane potential of cortical cells. Moreover, it did not produce sizable changes in membrane resistance. The major effect of adaptation, evident both in the presence and in the absence of a visual stimulus, was a tonic hyperpolarization. Adaptation affects a class of synaptic inputs, most likely excitatory in nature, that exert a tonic influence on cortical cells.},

	Abstract = {In his original description of autism, Kanner {\$}[{\$}1{\$}]{\$} noted that the parents of autistic children often exhibited unusual social behavior themselves, consistent with what we now know about the high heritability of autism [2]. We investigated this so-called Broad Autism Phenotype in the parents of children with autism, who themselves did not receive a diagnosis of any psychiatric illness. Building on recent quantifications of social cognition in autism [3], we investigated face processing by using the "bubbles" method [4] to measure how viewers make use of information from specific facial features in order to judge emotions. Parents of autistic children who were assessed as socially aloof (N = 15), a key component of the phenotype [5], showed a remarkable reduction in processing the eye region in faces, together with enhanced processing of the mouth, compared to a control group of parents of neurotypical children (N = 20), as well as to nonaloof parents of autistic children (N = 27, whose pattern of face processing was intermediate). The pattern of face processing seen in the Broad Autism Phenotype showed striking similarities to that previously reported to occur in autism [3] and for the first time provides a window into the endophenotype that may result from a subset of the genes that contribute to social cognition.},

	Abstract = {Based on an information theoretical approach, we investigate feature selection processes in saccadic object and scene analysis. Saccadic eye movements of human observers are recorded for a variety of natural and artificial test images. These experimental data are used for a statistical evaluation of the fixated image regions. Analysis of second-order statistics indicates that regions with higher spatial variance have a higher probability to be fixated, but no significant differences beyond these variance effects could be found at the level of power spectra. By contrast, an investigation with higher-order statistics, as reflected in the bispectral density, yielded clear structural differences between the image regions selected by saccadic eye movements as opposed to regions selected by a random process. These results indicate that nonredundant, intrinsically two-dimensional image features like curved lines and edges, occlusions, isolated spots, etc. play an important role in the saccadic selection process which must be integrated with top-down knowledge to fully predict object and scene analysis by human observers.},

	Abstract = {Previous research suggests that by 4 months of age infants use the eye gaze of adults to guide their attention and facilitate processing of environmental information. Here we address the question of how infants process the relation between another person and an external object. We applied an ERP paradigm to investigate the neural processes underlying the perception of the direction of an adult's eye gaze in 4-month-old infants. Infants showed differential processing of an adult's eye gaze, which was directed at a simultaneously presented object compared to non-object-directed eye gaze. This distinction was evident in two ERP components: The Negative component, reflecting attentional processes, and the positive slow wave, which is involved in memory encoding. The implications of these findings for the development of joint attention and related social cognitive functions are discussed.},

@article{watt2005a,
	Abstract = {Depth information from focus cues--accommodation and the gradient of retinal blur--is typically incorrect in three-dimensional (3-D) displays because the light comes from a planar display surface. If the visual system incorporates information from focus cues into its calculation of 3-D scene parameters, this could cause distortions in perceived depth even when the 2-D retinal images are geometrically correct. In Experiment 1 we measured the direct contribution of focus cues to perceived slant by varying independently the physical slant of the display surface and the slant of a simulated surface specified by binocular disparity (binocular viewing) or perspective/texture (monocular viewing). In the binocular condition, slant estimates were unaffected by display slant. In the monocular condition, display slant had a systematic effect on slant estimates. Estimates were consistent with a weighted average of slant from focus cues and slant from disparity/texture, where the cue weights are determined by the reliability of each cue. In Experiment 2, we examined whether focus cues also have an indirect effect on perceived slant via the distance estimate used in disparity scaling. We varied independently the simulated distance and the focal distance to a disparity-defined 3-D stimulus. Perceived slant was systematically affected by changes in focal distance. Accordingly, depth constancy (with respect to simulated distance) was significantly reduced when focal distance was held constant compared to when it varied appropriately with the simulated distance to the stimulus. The results of both experiments show that focus cues can contribute to estimates of 3-D scene parameters. Inappropriate focus cues in typical 3-D displays may therefore contribute to distortions in perceived space.},

Kiraly (2002) showed that 14-month-old infants imitate rationally, copying an adult's unusual action more often when it was freely chosen than when it was forced by some constraint. This suggests that infants understand others' intentions as rational choices of action plans. It is important to test whether apes also understand others' intentions in this way. In each of the current 3 studies, a comparison group of 14-month-olds used a tool more often when a demonstrator freely chose to use it than when she had to use it, but apes generally used the tool equally often in both conditions (orangutans were an exception). Only some apes thus show an understanding of others' intentions as rational choices of action plans.},

@article{anzai1999b,
	Abstract = {Complex cells in the striate cortex exhibit extensive spatiotemporal nonlinearities, presumably due to a convergence of various subunits. Because these subunits essentially determine many aspects of a complex cell receptive field (RF), such as tuning for orientation, spatial frequency, and binocular disparity, examination of the RF properties of subunits is important for understanding functional roles of complex cells. Although monocular aspects of these subunits have been studied, little is known about their binocular properties. Using a sophisticated RF mapping technique that employs binary m-sequences, we have examined binocular interactions exhibited by complex cells in the cat's striate cortex and the binocular RF properties of their underlying functional subunits. We find that binocular interaction RFs of complex cells exhibit subregions that are elongated along the frontoparallel axis at different binocular disparities. Therefore responses of complex cells are largely independent of monocular stimulus position or phase as long as the binocular disparity of the stimulus is kept constant. The binocular interaction RF is well described by a sum of binocular interaction RFs of underlying functional subunits, which exhibit simple cell-like RFs and a preference for different monocular phases but the same binocular disparity. For more than half of the complex cells examined, subunits of each cell are consistent with the characteristics specified by an energy model, with respect to the number of subunits as well as relationships between the subunit properties. Subunits exhibit RF binocular disparities that are largely consistent with a phase mechanism for encoding binocular disparity. These results indicate that binocular interactions of complex cells are derived from simple cell-like subunits, which exhibit multiplicative binocular interactions. Therefore binocular interactions of complex cells are also multiplicative. This suggests that complex cells compute something analogous to an interocular cross-correlation of images for a local region of visual space. The result of this computation can be used for solving the stereo correspondence problem.},

	Abstract = {Pyramidal neurons in layer 5 of the neocortex of the brain extend their axons and dendrites into all layers. They are also unusual in having both an axonal and a dendritic zone for the initiation of action potentials. Distal dendritic inputs, which normally appear greatly attenuated at the axon, must cross a high threshold at the dendritic initiation zone to evoke calcium action potentials but can then generate bursts of axonal action potentials. Here we show that a single back-propagating sodium action potential generated in the axon facilitates the initiation of these calcium action potentials when it coincides with distal dendritic input within a time window of several milliseconds. Inhibitory dendritic input can selectively block the initiation of dendritic calcium action potentials, preventing bursts of axonal action potentials. Thus, excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials arising in the distal dendrites can exert significantly greater control over action potential initiation in the axon than would be expected from their electrotonically isolated locations. The coincidence of a single back-propagating action potential with a subthreshold distal excitatory postsynaptic potential to evoke a burst of axonal action potentials represents a new mechanism by which the main cortical output neurons can associate inputs arriving at different cortical layers.},

	Abstract = {The enterohepatic circulation of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) is higher in thyrotoxicosis. Bile-salt sequestrants bind iodothyronines and thereby increase their fecal excretion. We, therefore, evaluated the effect of colestipol-hydrochloride administration on clinical and biochemical indices of patients with hyperthyroidism. In a prospective, controlled trial, ninety-two adult volunteers with Graves' disease, toxic autonomous nodule or toxic multinodular goiter were randomly assigned into the following treatment protocols: Group 1, 30 mg of methimazole (MMI) and 20 g of colestipol-hydrochloride (COL) daily; Group 2, 30 mg of MMI daily; and Group 3, 15 mg of MMI 20 g of COL daily. The patients were further classified into Group A, severe hyperthyroidism (baseline levels of total T3 (TT3) > or =5 nmol/l) and Group B, mild to moderate thyrotoxicosis (baseline levels of TT-3<5 nmol/l). Crook's clinical index, serum free T4 (FT4), TT3 and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels were determined before (WO), following one week (W1) and two weeks (W2) of treatment. Serum TT3 level decreased (mean+/-SE) at W1 by 40.8+/-2.6% of WO in Group1 and by 29.2+/-2.4% in Group 2 (p<0.001), and down further to 47.8+/-3.0% at W2 in Group 1, and 40.6+/-2.8% in Group 2 (p=0.01). Serum FT4 level decreased (mean+/-SE) from WO to W1 by 31.7+/-2.7% in Group 1 and by 16.2+/-3.1% in Group 2 (p=0.005), and down to 49.1+/-2.8% of WO at W2 in Group 1 and to 38.7+/-3.5% in Group 2 (p=0.07). In sub groups B COL was not effective in reducing thyroid hormone levels nor in ameliorating the clinical status of the patients. However, in Group A3 COL lowered FT4 (p=0.001) and TT3 (p=0.05) levels as compared to group A2. At W2 the clinical hyperthyroidism score improved faster in Group A1 (p<0.001) and Group A3 (p=0.012) as compared to the control Group A2. In conclusion, COL is an effective and well tolerated adjunctive agent in the treatment of hyperthyroidism. Its main effect is in severe cases of thyrotoxicosis, and in the first phase of treatment. As adjunctive COL treatment in hyperthyroidism allows reducing MMI dosage it may decrease the rate of dose dependent MMI side effects.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The optimal antithyroid drug regimen for Graves' disease remains a matter of controversy. The European Multicentre Trial Group has investigated the effects of methimazole drug dose on the long-term outcome of Graves' disease. DESIGN: Extended follow-up of patients from a prospective multicentre trial, designed to study methimazole dose effects on the outcome of Graves' disease. We have reported previously that the relapse rates did not differ after a medication-free observation period of 12 months; the relapse rates were 37% and 38%, respectively. In this paper, we describe the outcome in these patients after a mean observation period of 4.3 +/- 1.3 years and have looked for potential predictors of this outcome. PATIENTS: Three hundred and thirteen patients with Graves' disease were randomized to treatment with a constant dose of 10 or 40 mg of methimazole for 1 year, with levothyroxine supplementation as required. MEASUREMENTS: At the time of inclusion into the trial: thyroid size, T4, T3, TSH-binding inhibiting immunoglobulins, urinary iodide excretion, thyroid uptake, Crook's therapeutic index of hyperthyroidism (a measure of clinical disease severity). At the time of follow-up examination: TSH, T4, T3, thyroid size, thyroid ultrasound, THS-binding inhibiting immunoglobulins. RESULTS: The overall relapse rate was 58%. There was no difference in relapse rates between patients treated with either 10 or 40 mg of methimazole (58.3 vs. 57.8%). Five patients had become spontaneously hypothyroid, without obvious relationship to antithyroid drug dose. Patients who relapsed and patients who remained in remission did not differ with respect to: age, goitre size, ophthalmopathy, median iodine excretion, serum T4 or serum T3, Crook's therapeutic index and thyroid uptake at the time of study entry. Thus, none of these variables was potentially suitable for predicting outcome. This finding was confirmed by Cox's proportional hazard regression. Thyroid volume, measured by ultrasound, did not differ between patients in remission and patients with relapse. There was no difference in the course of endocrine eye signs, in the requirement for steroid and radiotherapy for eye signs, or in thyroid echostructure between patients in the 10 and in the 40 mg group, nor was serum TSH different in patients who had remained in remission (0.8 +/- 0.6 mU/l in the 10 mg group, 1.0 +/- 0.8 mU/l in the 40 mg group). CONCLUSIONS: The dose of methimazole in Graves' disease therapy can safely be kept to the minimal required dose. This will provide the same chance of remission as higher doses, and provide the best balance of risk and benefit.},

Biophysical measurements from cells in the blowfly retina yield estimates of the ATP required to generate graded (analog) electrical signals that transmit known amounts of information.

It costs 10(4) ATP molecules to transmit a bit at a chemical synapse, and 10(6)-10(7) ATP for graded signals in an interneuron or a photoreceptor, or for spike coding. Therefore, in noise-limited signaling systems, a weak pathway of low capacity transmits information more economically, which promotes the distribution of information among multiple pathways.},

	Abstract = {Several studies have shown that the information conveyed by bell-shaped tuning curves increases as their width decreases, leading to the notion that sharpening of tuning curves improves population codes. This notion, however, is based on assumptions that the noise distribution is independent among neurons and independent of the tuning curve width. Here we reexamine these assumptions in networks of spiking neurons by using orientation selectivity as an example. We compare two principal classes of model: one in which the tuning curves are sharpened through cortical lateral interactions, and one in which they are not. We report that sharpening through lateral interactions does not improve population codes but, on the contrary, leads to a severe loss of information. In addition, the sharpening models generate complicated codes that rely extensively on pairwise correlations. Our study generates several experimental predictions that can be used to distinguish between these two classes of model.},

	Abstract = {We investigated the interactions between visual, tactile and auditory sensory signals for the perception of sequences of events. Sequences of flashes, taps and beeps were presented simultaneously. For each session, subjects were instructed to count the number of events presented in one modality (Target) and to ignore the stimuli presented in the other modalities (Background). The number of events presented in the background sequence could differ from the number of events in the target sequence. For each session, we quantified the Background-evoked bias by comparing subjects' responses with and without Background (Target presented alone). Nine combinations between vision, touch and audition were tested. In each session but two, the Background significantly biased the Target. Vision was the most susceptible to Background-evoked bias and the least efficient in biasing the other two modalities. By contrast, audition was the least susceptible to Background-evoked bias and the most efficient in biasing the other two modalities. These differences were strongly correlated to the relative reliability of each modality. In line with this, the evoked biases were larger when the Background consisted of two instead of only one modality. These results show that for the perception of sequences of events: (1) vision, touch and audition are automatically integrated; (2) the respective contributions of the three modalities to the integrated percept differ; (3) the relative contribution of each modality depends on its relative reliability (1/variability); (4) task-irrelevant stimuli have more weight when presented in two rather than only one modality.},

	Abstract = {Kinesin is a processive motor that takes 8.3-nm center-of-mass steps along microtubules for each adenosine triphosphate hydrolyzed. Whether kinesin moves by a "hand-over-hand" or an "inchworm" model has been controversial. We have labeled a single head of the kinesin dimer with a Cy3 fluorophore and localized the position of the dye to within 2 nm before and after a step. We observed that single kinesin heads take steps of 17.3 +/- 3.3 nm. A kinetic analysis of the dwell times between steps shows that the 17-nm steps alternate with 0-nm steps. These results strongly support a hand-over-hand mechanism, and not an inchworm mechanism. In addition, our results suggest that kinesin is bound by both heads to the microtubule while it waits for adenosine triphosphate in between steps.},

	Abstract = {Neurons process and encode information by generating sequences of action potentials. For all spiking neurons, the encoding of single-neuron computations into sequences of spikes is biophysically determined by the cell's action-potential-generating mechanism. It has recently been discovered that apparently minor modifications of this mechanism can qualitatively change the nature of neuronal encoding. Here we quantitatively analyse the dynamics of action potential initiation in cortical neurons in vivo, in vitro and in computational models. Unexpectedly, key features of the initiation dynamics of cortical neuron action potentials--their rapid initiation and variable onset potential--are outside the range of behaviours described by the classical Hodgkin-Huxley theory. We propose a new model based on the cooperative activation of sodium channels that reproduces the observed dynamics of action potential initiation. This new model predicts that Hodgkin-Huxley-type dynamics of action potential initiation can be induced by artificially decreasing the effective density of sodium channels. In vitro experiments confirm this prediction, supporting the hypothesis that cooperative sodium channel activation underlies the dynamics of action potential initiation in cortical neurons.},

@article{ohzawa1985a,
	Abstract = {We have examined the idea that the adaptation of cortical neurons to local contrast levels in a visual stimulus is functionally advantageous. Specifically, cortical cells may have large differential contrast sensitivity as a result of adjustments that center a limited response range around a mean level of contrast. To evaluate this notion, we measured contrast-response functions of cells in striate cortex while systematically adapting them to different contrast levels of stimulus gratings. For the majority of cortical neurons tested, the results of this basic experiment show that contrast-response functions shift laterally along a log-contrast axis so that response functions match mean contrast levels in the stimulus. This implies a contrast-dependent change in the gain of the cell's contrast-response relationship. We define this process as contrast gain control. The degree to which this contrast adjustment occurs varies considerably from cell to cell. There are no obvious differences regarding cell type (simple vs. complex) or laminar distribution. Contrast gain control is almost certainly a cortical function, since lateral geniculate cells and fibers exhibit only minimal effects. Tests presented in the accompanying paper (37) provide additional evidence on the cortical origin of the process. In another series of experiments, the effect of contrast adaptation on physiological estimates of contrast sensitivity was evaluated. Sustained adaptation to contrast levels as low as 3% was capable of nearly doubling the thresholds of most of the cells tested. Adaptation may therefore be an important factor in determinations of the contrast sensitivity of cortical neurons. We tested the spatial extent of the mechanisms responsible for these gain-control effects by attempting to adapt cells using both a large grating and a grating patch limited to that portion of a cell's receptive field from which excitatory discharges could be elicited directly (the central discharge region). Adaptation was found to be an exclusive property of the central region. This held even in the case of hypercomplex cells, which received strong influences from surrounding regions of the visual field. Finally, we measured the time course of contrast adaptation. We found the process to be rather slow, with a mean time constant of approximately 6 s. Once again, there was considerable variability in this value from cell to cell.},

	Abstract = {Thyroid hormone has important actions in the adult brain, and it is well accepted that hypothyroidism is associated with neuropsychiatric complaints and symptoms. Neuropsychiatric symptoms refer to a spectrum of emotional and cognitive problems that are directly related to changes in the brain secondary to multiple factors, including the direct effects of thyroid disease, as well as hormone deprivation in brain tissue. Hypothyroidism impacts aspects of cognitive functioning and mood. More severe hypothyroidism can mimic melancholic de-pression and dementia. Neuropsychiatric symptoms tend to improve with treatment and normalization to a euthyroid state, though the pattern is inconsistent and complete recovery is uncertain. The degree to which mild hypothyroidism, or subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH), impacts mood and cognitive functions and whether these symptoms respond to treatment, remains controversial. Most studies support a relationship between thyroid state and cognition, particularly slowed information processing speed, reduced efficiency in executive functions, and poor learning. Furthermore, hypo-thyroidism is associated with an increased susceptibility to depression and reductions in health-related quality of life. Controlled studies suggest that cognitive and mood symptoms improve with treatment, though the data are equivocal and limited by diverse methodologies. Functional neuroimaging data provide support for the mood and cognitive findings and treatment reversibility for both overt and SCH. These findings are not, however, without controversy. Recent investigations into the impact of SCH on cognition and mood, coupled epidemiological studies investigating the normal spectrum of thyroid stimulating hormone, have fueled significant debate regarding the appropriate, healthy range for TSH levels. This has led to concern over whether patients with overt hypothyroidism may be undertreated and whether SCH patients are truly out of the range of normal thyroid functioning and should be treated. The following is a review of the extant literature on the impact of hypothyroidism on cognition and mood, reversibility of symptoms, and treatment approaches. The spectrum of thyroid disease is reviewed, but mild, or subclinical, hypothyroidism is emphasized. The potential role of autoimmunity in neuropsychiatric symptoms and treatment resistance is addressed. Limitations of the current literature and future directions are discussed.},

	Abstract = {The organization of cat primary visual cortex has been well mapped using simple stimuli such as sinusoidal gratings, revealing superimposed maps of orientation and spatial frequency preferences. However, it is not yet understood how complex images are represented across these maps. In this study, we ask whether a linear filter model can explain how cortical spatial frequency domains are activated by complex images. The model assumes that the response to a stimulus at any point on the cortical surface can be predicted by its individual orientation, spatial frequency, and temporal frequency tuning curves. To test this model, we imaged the pattern of activity within cat area 17 in response to stimuli composed of multiple spatial frequencies. Consistent with the predictions of the model, the stimuli activated low and high spatial frequency domains differently: at low stimulus drift speeds, both domains were strongly activated, but activity fell off in high spatial frequency domains as drift speed increased. To determine whether the filter model quantitatively predicted the activity patterns, we measured the spatiotemporal tuning properties of the functional domains in vivo and calculated expected response amplitudes from the model. The model accurately predicted cortical response patterns for two types of complex stimuli drifting at a variety of speeds. These results suggest that the distributed activity of primary visual cortex can be predicted from cortical maps like those of orientation and SF preference generated using simple, sinusoidal stimuli, and that dynamic visual acuity is degraded at or before the level of area 17.},

@article{goodale1994a,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Earlier work with neurological patients has shown that the visual perception of object size and orientation depends on visual pathways in the cerebral cortex that are separate from those mediating the use of these same object properties in the control of goal-directed grasping. We present evidence suggesting that the same dissociation between perception and action is evident in the visual processing of object shape. In other words, discrimination between objects on the basis of their shape appears to be mediated by visual mechanisms that are functionally and neurally distinct from those controlling the pre-shaping of the hand during grasping movements directed at those same objects. RESULTS: We studied two patients with lesions in different parts of the cerebral visual pathways. One patient (RV), who had sustained bilateral lesions of the occipitoparietal cortex, was unable to use visual information to place her fingers correctly on the circumference of irregularly shaped objects when asked to pick them up, even though she had no difficulty in visually discriminating one such object from another. Conversely, a second patient (DF), who had bilateral damage in the ventrolateral occipital region, had no difficulty in placing her fingers on appropriate opposition points during grasping, even though she was unable to discriminate visually amongst such objects. CONCLUSIONS: This double dissociation lends strong support to the idea that the visual mechanisms mediating the perception of objects are functionally and neurally distinct from those mediating the control of skilled actions directed at those objects. It also supports the recent proposal of Goodale and Milner that visual perception depends on a ventral stream of projections from the primary visual cortex to the inferotemporal cortex, whereas the visual control of skilled actions depends on a dorsal stream from the primary visual cortex to the posterior parietal cortex.},

@article{kay2008a,
	Abstract = {A challenging goal in neuroscience is to be able to read out, or decode, mental content from brain activity. Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have decoded orientation, position and object category from activity in visual cortex. However, these studies typically used relatively simple stimuli (for example, gratings) or images drawn from fixed categories (for example, faces, houses), and decoding was based on previous measurements of brain activity evoked by those same stimuli or categories. To overcome these limitations, here we develop a decoding method based on quantitative receptive-field models that characterize the relationship between visual stimuli and fMRI activity in early visual areas. These models describe the tuning of individual voxels for space, orientation and spatial frequency, and are estimated directly from responses evoked by natural images. We show that these receptive-field models make it possible to identify, from a large set of completely novel natural images, which specific image was seen by an observer. Identification is not a mere consequence of the retinotopic organization of visual areas; simpler receptive-field models that describe only spatial tuning yield much poorer identification performance. Our results suggest that it may soon be possible to reconstruct a picture of a person's visual experience from measurements of brain activity alone.},

	Abstract = {The auditory system encodes sound by decomposing the amplitude signal arriving at the ear into multiple frequency bands whose center frequencies and bandwidths are approximately exponential functions of the distance from the stapes. This organization is thought to result from the adaptation of cochlear mechanisms to the animal's auditory environment. Here we report that several basic auditory nerve fiber tuning properties can be accounted for by adapting a population of filter shapes to encode natural sounds efficiently. The form of the code depends on sound class, resembling a Fourier transformation when optimized for animal vocalizations and a wavelet transformation when optimized for non-biological environmental sounds. Only for the combined set does the optimal code follow scaling characteristics of physiological data. These results suggest that auditory nerve fibers encode a broad set of natural sounds in a manner consistent with information theoretic principles.},

	Abstract = {Selective attention is a fundamental cognitive function that uses top-down signals to orient and prioritize information processing in the brain. Single-cell recordings from behaving monkeys have revealed a number of attention-induced effects on sensory neurons, and have given rise to contrasting viewpoints about the neural underpinning of attentive processing. Moreover, there is evidence that attentional signals originate from the prefrontoparietal working memory network, but precisely how a source area of attention interacts with a sensory system remains unclear. To address these questions, we investigated a biophysically based network model of spiking neurons composed of a reciprocally connected loop of two (sensory and working memory) networks. We found that a wide variety of physiological phenomena induced by selective attention arise naturally in such a system. In particular, our work demonstrates a neural circuit that instantiates the "feature-similarity gain modulation principle," according to which the attentional gain effect on sensory neuronal responses is a graded function of the difference between the attended feature and the preferred feature of the neuron, independent of the stimulus. Furthermore, our model identifies key circuit mechanisms that underlie feature-similarity gain modulation, multiplicative scaling of tuning curve, and biased competition, and provide specific testable predictions. These results offer a synthetic account of the diverse attentional effects, suggesting a canonical neural circuit for feature-based attentional processing in the cortex.},

	Abstract = {Understanding how neural activity in sensory cortices relates to perception is a central theme of neuroscience. Action potentials of sensory cortical neurons can be strongly correlated to properties of sensory stimuli and reflect the subjective judgements of an individual about stimuli. Microstimulation experiments have established a direct link from sensory activity to behaviour, suggesting that small neuronal populations can influence sensory decisions. However, microstimulation does not allow identification and quantification of the stimulated cellular elements. The sensory impact of individual cortical neurons therefore remains unknown. Here we show that stimulation of single neurons in somatosensory cortex affects behavioural responses in a detection task. We trained rats to respond to microstimulation of barrel cortex at low current intensities. We then initiated short trains of action potentials in single neurons by juxtacellular stimulation. Animals responded significantly more often in single-cell stimulation trials than in catch trials without stimulation. Stimulation effects varied greatly between cells, and on average in 5% of trials a response was induced. Whereas stimulation of putative excitatory neurons led to weak biases towards responding, stimulation of putative inhibitory neurons led to more variable and stronger sensory effects. Reaction times for single-cell stimulation were long and variable. Our results demonstrate that single neuron activity can cause a change in the animal's detection behaviour, suggesting a much sparser cortical code for sensations than previously anticipated.},

	Abstract = {Previous neurophysiological studies suggest that attention can alter the baseline or gain of neurons in extrastriate visual areas but that it cannot change tuning. This suggests that neurons in visual cortex function as labeled lines whose meaning does not depend on task demands. To test this common assumption, we used a system identification approach to measure spatial frequency and orientation tuning in area V4 during two attentionally demanding visual search tasks, one that required fixation and one that allowed free viewing during search. We found that spatial attention modulates response baseline and gain but does not alter tuning, consistent with previous reports. In contrast, feature-based attention often shifts neuronal tuning. These tuning shifts are inconsistent with the labeled-line model and tend to enhance responses to stimulus features that distinguish the search target. Our data suggest that V4 neurons behave as matched filters that are dynamically tuned to optimize visual search.},

	Abstract = {How does the high selectivity to stimulus orientation emerge in the visual cortex? Thalamic feedforward-dominated models of orientation selectivity predict constant selectivity during the visual response, whereas intracortical recurrent models predict dynamic improvement in selectivity. We imaged the cat visual cortex with voltage-sensitive dyes to measure orientation-tuning dynamics of a large neuronal population. Tuning-curve width did not narrow after response onset, whereas the difference between preferred and orthogonal responses (modulation depth) first increased, then declined. We identified a suppression of the evoked responses, referred to as the evoked deceleration-acceleration (DA) notch, which was larger for the orthogonal response. Furthermore, peak selectivity of the tuning curves was contemporaneous with the evoked DA notch. These findings suggest that in the cat brain, sustained visual cortical processing does not narrow orientation tuning; rather, intracortical interactions may amplify modulation depth and suppress the orthogonal response relatively more than the preferred. Thus, feedforward models and recurrent models of orientation selectivity must be combined.},

0/Reliability analysis. From very early on the orientation maps starts to be reliable. At 36 ms the maps emerges. THEY USE A CONTRAST OF 100%. So Black-VS-White!!! 36 ms is the first reproducible map. 


Important quote:

"The NSC here is considerably larger than that normally reported in simple cells. 
However, the optical signal is dominated by the superficial layers, in which the more common 
neurons are complex cells. In these cells, the intracellular NSC is considerably larger than in 
simple cells---in a few cells it was up to 67%, although in others it was almost absent (39). 
Furthermore, the optical signal emphasizes activity in dendritic tufts that spread laterally, 
beyond the borders of orientation domains of neuronal somata."

Selectivity: MD/(HWHHxNSC). But they state that HWHH is more or less constant over time so basically selectivity is the ration of MD to NSC.


1/Over time, tuning curves of the pixels do not sharpen or sharpens only marjinally.  The sharpest tuning curve is obtained already at 33-36 ms. At around 74 ms it increases to 36-38

2/ MD increases until 74ms after stim onset.

3/Selectivitity peaked at 55-100 ms.

" this temporal profile was affected mainly by the ratio between the selective component (MD) and the nonselective one. This normalized MD (preferred -- or- 
thogonal/orthogonal) peaked at 55 to 100 ms 
over the additional 10 hemispheres"


3/ DA notch: At the moment  the SELECTIVITY INDEX PEAKED THERE WAS IN THE SAME TIME A NOTCH. The peak of the selectivity was reached within 10 ms  of the acceleration at the end of the evoked DA notch....

they show that the DA notch is stronger for the unselective pixels. However what we show is that stronger the A component of the DA notch, more unspecific the cortex becomes. these are different things. So they say the highest specificity is reached after the A part. However },

	Abstract = {According to Barlow's seminal "efficient coding hypothesis," the coding strategy of sensory neurons should be matched to the statistics of stimuli that occur in an animal's natural habitat. Using an automatic search technique, we here test this hypothesis and identify stimulus ensembles that sensory neurons are optimized for. Focusing on grasshopper auditory receptor neurons, we find that their optimal stimulus ensembles differ from the natural environment, but largely overlap with a behaviorally important sub-ensemble of the natural sounds. This indicates that the receptors are optimized for peak rather than average performance. More generally, our results suggest that the coding strategies of sensory neurons are heavily influenced by differences in behavioral relevance among natural stimuli.},

	Abstract = {DNA methylation is a covalent chemical modification of DNA catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). DNA methylation is associated with transcriptional silencing and has been studied extensively as a lifelong molecular information storage mechanism put in place during development. Here we report that DNMT gene expression is upregulated in the adult rat hippocampus following contextual fear conditioning and that DNMT inhibition blocks memory formation. In addition, fear conditioning is associated with rapid methylation and transcriptional silencing of the memory suppressor gene PP1 and demethylation and transcriptional activation of the synaptic plasticity gene reelin, indicating both methyltransferase and demethylase activity during consolidation. DNMT inhibition prevents the PP1 methylation increase, resulting in aberrant transcription of the gene during the memory-consolidation period. These results demonstrate that DNA methylation is dynamically regulated in the adult nervous system and that this cellular mechanism is a crucial step in memory formation.},

	Abstract = {The human brain evolved to function and survive in a highly stimulating, complex and fast-changing world. Attempting to ascertain the neural substrates of operating in naturalistic contexts represents a huge challenge. Recently, however, researchers have begun to use several innovative analysis methods to interrogate functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data collected during dynamic naturalistic tasks. Central to these new developments is the inventive approach taken to segregating neural activity linked to specific events within the overall continuous stream of complex stimulation. In this review, we discuss the recent literature, detailing the key studies and their methods. These analytical techniques can be applied in a wide range of cognitive domains and, thus, offer exciting new opportunities for gaining insights into the brain bases of thoughts and behaviours in the real-world setting where they normally occur.},

	Abstract = {Two experiments are reported in which inhibition of return (IOR)was examined wit h single-responsetasks (either manual responses alone or saccadic responses alone) and dual-response tasks (simultaneous manual and saccadic responses). The first experiment-using guided limb movements that require considerable spatial information-showed more IOR for saccades than for pointing responses. In addition, saccadic IOR was reduced with concurrent pointing movements, but manual IOR was not affected by concurrent saccades. Importantly, at the time of saccade initiation, the arm movements did not start yet, indicating that the influence on saccade IOR is due to arm-movement preparation. In the second experiment, using localization keypress responses that required only minimal spatial information, greater IOR was again found for saccadic than for manual responses, but no effect of concurrent movements was found. These findings add further support that there is a dissociation between oculomotor and skeletal-motor IOR. Moreover, the results show that the preparation manual responses tend to mediate saccadic behavior-but only when the manual responses require high levels of spatial accuracy-and that the superior colliculus is the likely neural substrate integrating IOR for eye and arm movements.},

	Abstract = {Natural vision is a highly dynamic process. Frequent body, head, and eye movements constantly bring new images onto the retina for brief periods, challenging our understanding of the neural code for vision. We report that certain retinal ganglion cells encode the spatial structure of a briefly presented image in the relative timing of their first spikes. This code is found to be largely invariant to stimulus contrast and robust to noisy fluctuations in response latencies. Mechanistically, the observed response characteristics result from different kinetics in two retinal pathways ("ON" and "OFF") that converge onto ganglion cells. This mechanism allows the retina to rapidly and reliably transmit new spatial information with the very first spikes emitted by a neural population.},

	Abstract = {In the real world, objects never occur in isolation; they co-vary with other objects and particular environments, providing a rich source of contextual associations to be exploited by the visual system. A natural way of representing the context of an object is in terms of its relationship to other objects. Alternately, recent work has shown that a statistical summary of the scene provides a complementary and effective source of information for contextual inference, which enables humans to quickly guide their attention and eyes to regions of interest in natural scenes. A better understanding of how humans build such scene representations, and of the mechanisms of contextual analysis, will lead to a new generation of computer vision systems.},

	Abstract = {Previous research suggests that the allocation of attention is largely controlled either in a stimulus-driven or in a goal-driven manner. To date, few studies have systematically manipulated variables affecting stimulus-driven and goal-driven selection independently in order to investigate how both manners of control interrelate and affect performance in visual search. In the present study observers were presented with search displays consisting of an array of line segments rotated at various orientations. The task of observers was to indicate the presence or absence of a vertical line segment (the target) presented amongst a series of nontargets and possibly one distractor. By varying the absolute differences in orientation between the target, nontargets, and distractors, relative target-distractor salience and target-distractor similarity were independently manipulated to investigate the contribution of stimulus-driven and goal-driven control. The major result was that relative target-distractor salience and target-distractor similarity affected search performance independently. Performance was better in cases where the irrelevant distractor was not a salient item in the search display and did not look similar to the target. The results are discussed in terms of models of attentional control.},

	Abstract = {Single-cell responses in visual cortex to a target falling within their receptive field can be modified by collinear flanking stimuli concurrently presented outside the receptive field. Here, we report the presence of four types of contrast-dependent lateral effects: (1) facilitation at low target contrasts and suppression at high contrasts, (2) facilitation that increases with contrast, (3) suppression that increases with contrast, and (4) suppression at low contrasts with facilitation at high contrasts. We propose a sensitivity modulation model that accounts for all the four types of lateral effects by changes in two parameters. In this model, activation of neighboring neurons changes the sensitivities of the target neuron to both the direct feedforward input and inhibitory, divisive feedback from neighboring neurons.},

	Abstract = {Biological networks have so many possible states that exhaustive sampling is impossible. Successful analysis thus depends on simplifying hypotheses, but experiments on many systems hint that complicated, higher-order interactions among large groups of elements have an important role. Here we show, in the vertebrate retina, that weak correlations between pairs of neurons coexist with strongly collective behaviour in the responses of ten or more neurons. We find that this collective behaviour is described quantitatively by models that capture the observed pairwise correlations but assume no higher-order interactions. These maximum entropy models are equivalent to Ising models, and predict that larger networks are completely dominated by correlation effects. This suggests that the neural code has associative or error-correcting properties, and we provide preliminary evidence for such behaviour. As a first test for the generality of these ideas, we show that similar results are obtained from networks of cultured cortical neurons.},

	Abstract = {We have investigated how the nonclassical receptive field (nCRF) affects information transmission by V1 neurons during simulated natural vision in awake, behaving macaques. Stimuli were centered over the classical receptive field (CRF) and stimulus size was varied from one to four times the diameter of the CRF. Stimulus movies reproduced the spatial and temporal stimulus dynamics of natural vision while maintaining constant CRF stimulation across all sizes. In individual neurons, stimulation of the nCRF significantly increases the information rate, the information per spike, and the efficiency of information transmission. Furthermore, the population averages of these quantities also increase significantly with nCRF stimulation. These data demonstrate that the nCRF increases the sparseness of the stimulus representation in V1, suggesting that the nCRF tunes V1 neurons to match the highly informative components of the natural world.},

	Annote = {this is the extended version of their science paper. Extension is done so that the analysis include the information theoretical analysis. they show that 1/ nCRF stimulation in average suppresses the responses, but has also excitatory influences on a considerable amount of cells. Indeed the number of supp. and excited neurons amounts more or less equal but the effect on suppression is much stronger. As a results a net suppression is observed on the population level. 2/nCRF stimulation increases the information rate, 3/ information per spike : this is the ratio of information rate and spike counts for a given stimulus size. As the spike numbers decreases with stimulus size this boosts the information per spikes. this is the ration of figure 5D to figure 6D 4/ and efficiency, this is the ration of mutual information to response entropy. gives an estimation of how a neuron uses its bandwidth.

Because efficienc y does not ex plicitl y de- pend on spike rate, thi s result complements the findi ng that nCRF sti mulation i ncreases the amount of i nformation available i n each spike and confirms the last of our predictions. " 3/ Interestingly the selectivity of neurons are not correlated with the average information between response and stimuli. Rather the information per spike is correlated with selectivity. This means that neurons having a big mutual information with stimuli do indeed use an amount which is very small compared to the full range of information they can convey. 4/importantly increases in information alone is not very informative as a statement when comparing different sizes. The reason is that the increase mutual information can be causes by a decrease of noise entropy and/or by a increase of total entropy or by a combination of these two. they found that both total and noise entropy reduces with size. "If nCRF sti mulation i ncreases the total response entropy, then the nCRF must i ncrease the dy namic range of the neuron and /or the reliabilit y of spikes elicited by the sti mulus.

	Abstract = {The response to treatment in Graves' hyperthyroidism is unpredictable, and factors postulated to predict outcome have not generally proved clinically useful or been widely adopted in clinical practice. We audited outcome in 536 patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism presenting consecutively to determine whether simple clinical features predict disease presentation and response to treatment. At presentation males had slightly more severe biochemical hyperthyroidism [free T4: males, 64.3 +/- 3.0 pmol/L (mean +/- SE); females, 61.3 +/- 1.7 (P = 0.45); free T3: males, 24.3 +/- 1.5 pmol/L; females, 21.0 +/- 0.6, (P = 0.04)]. Patients less than 40 yr at diagnosis had more severe hyperthyroidism than patients more than 40 yr old [free T4: <40 yr, 64.3 +/- 2.0; >40 yr, 56.7 +/- 2.3 (P = 0.02); free T3: <40 yr, 22.8 +/- 0.8; >40 yr, 19.0 +/- 0.9 (P = 0.003)]. Males had a lower remission rate than females after a course of antithyroid medication [19.6% vs. 40%; odds ratio, 0.37; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.17-0.79; P < 0.01]. Similarly, patients aged less than 40 yr had a lower remission rate than older patients (32.6% vs. 47.8%; odds ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.32-0.87; P = 0.01). One dose of radioiodine cured hyperthyroidism in fewer males than females (47% vs. 74%; P < 0.0001). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated male sex (odds ratio, 2.80; 95% CI, 1.31-5.98; P = 0.008), serum free T4 concentration at diagnosis (odds ratio, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.0-1.04; P = 0.01), and dose of radioiodine administered (odds ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.99-1.00; P = 0.001) were contributing factors associated with failure to respond to a single dose of radioiodine. As males and younger patients are more likely to fail to respond to medical treatment, and male patients are likewise less likely to respond to a single dose of radioiodine, we suggest that those groups with low remission rates should be offered definitive treatment with radioiodine or surgery soon after presentation and that the value of higher initial doses of radioiodine in males be evaluated.},

	Abstract = {This intracellular study investigates synaptic mechanisms of orientation and direction selectivity in cat area 17. Visually evoked inhibition was analyzed in 88 cells by detecting spike suppression, hyperpolarization, and reduction of trial-to-trial variability of membrane potential. In 25 of these cells, inhibition visibility was enhanced by depolarization and spike inactivation and by direct measurement of synaptic conductances. We conclude that excitatory and inhibitory inputs share the tuning preference of spiking output in 60% of cases, whereas inhibition is tuned to a different orientation in 40% of cases. For this latter type of cells, conductance measurements showed that excitation shared either the preference of the spiking output or that of the inhibition. This diversity of input combinations may reflect inhomogeneities in functional intracortical connectivity regulated by correlation-based activity-dependent processes.},

@article{olshausen1996a,
	Abstract = {The receptive fields of simple cells in mammalian primary visual cortex can be characterized as being spatially localized, oriented and bandpass (selective to structure at different spatial scales), comparable to the basis functions of wavelet transforms. One approach to understanding such response properties of visual neurons has been to consider their relationship to the statistical structure of natural images in terms of efficient coding. Along these lines, a number of studies have attempted to train unsupervised learning algorithms on natural images in the hope of developing receptive fields with similar properties, but none has succeeded in producing a full set that spans the image space and contains all three of the above properties. Here we investigate the proposal that a coding strategy that maximizes sparseness is sufficient to account for these properties. We show that a learning algorithm that attempts to find sparse linear codes for natural scenes will develop a complete family of localized, oriented, bandpass receptive fields, similar to those found in the primary visual cortex. The resulting sparse image code provides a more efficient representation for later stages of processing because it possesses a higher degree of statistical independence among its outputs.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The present study was to compare the efficacy of a single daily dose of methimazole (MMI) and propylthiouracil (PTU) in the treatment of Graves' hyperthyroidism. BACKGROUND: Antithyroid drugs, MMI and PTU, are widely used in the treatment of hyperthyroidism. Previous studies in the treatment of hyperthyroidism with a single daily dose of antithyroid drugs have demonstrated a more favourable result with MMI. However, the efficacy of a single daily dose of PTU was inconsistent. In this study, we examined the therapeutic efficacy of single daily doses of MMI and PTU on the change of thyroid hormones and thyrotropin receptor antibodies (TRAb) levels. METHODS: Thirty patients with newly diagnosed Graves' hyperthyroidism were randomly divided into two groups, each receiving a single dose of either 15 mg MMI or 150 mg PTU daily for 12 weeks. The therapeutic efficacy was determined by serum total triiodothyronine (TT3), total thyroxine (TT4), thyrotropin (TSH), free thyroxine (FT4), and TRAb levels at baseline and at the end of 4, 8 and 12 weeks during the study period. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in baseline thyroid function parameters. Serum TT3, TT4 and FT4 levels in the MMI-treated group were significantly lower than those of the PTU-treated group after 4 weeks and through the end of the study. MMI also has superior effect on reducing serum TRAb levels than PTU after 8 weeks and at the end of the study. CONCLUSION: During the 12-week treatment of Graves' hyperthyroidism, a single daily dose of 15 mg MMI was much more effective in the induction of euthyroidism than a single daily dose of 150 mg PTU. In the doses used in this study, MMI is preferable to PTU when a once-daily regimen of antithyroid drug is considered for the treatment of Graves' hyperthyroidism.},

	Abstract = {To explore the role of primary visual cortex in contour integration, we measured the contextual sensitivity of human contrast thresholds and of superficial layer complex cells in monkey V1. An observer's contrast detection was 40% improved by a second suprathreshold bar; the effect was decreased as the two bars were separated along their axis of orientation, were displaced from colinearity, and had their relative orientation changed. Recordings from V1 showed that 42% of complex cells demonstrated facilitation for a second bar outside their classical receptive fields with a similar dependency on relative location and orientation. Both effects were eliminated by an orthogonal line between the two iso-oriented lines. Multiple randomly placed and oriented lines in the receptive field surround often caused a reduction in a cell's response to an optimally oriented stimulus, but this inhibition could be eliminated by changing the orientation of a few of these elements to colinearity with the centrally located target.},

Both the total power in a spectrum (corresponding to image contrast) and its dependence on spatial frequency vary considerably between images, and also within images when considered as functions of orientation. A series of probabilistic models for power spectra enabled calculating the information obtained from prior knowledge of parameters describing spectra. Most information is gained from contrast, 1/f2 spatial frequency behaviour, and contrast as a function of orientation. Variations in spatial frequency behaviour are relatively unimportant. For oriented contrast, a bandwidth of 10-30 deg is sufficient to obtain most information.},

@article{fregnac2003a,
	Abstract = {Brain computation, in the early visual system, is often considered as a hierarchical process in which features extracted in a given sensory relay are not present in previous stages of integration. In particular, orientation preference and its fine tuning selectivity are functional properties shared by most cortical cells and they are not observed at the preceding geniculate stage. A classical problem is identifying the mechanisms and circuitry underlying these computations. Several organizational principles have been proposed, giving different weights to the feedforward thalamocortical drive or to intracortical recurrent architectures. Within this context, an important issue is whether intracortical inhibition is fundamental for the genesis of stimulus selectivity, or rather normalizes spike response tuning with respect to other features such as stimulus strength or contrast, without influencing the selectivity bias and preference expressed in the excitatory input alone. We review here experimental observations concerning the presence or absence of inhibitory input evoked by non-preferred orientation/directions. Intracellular current clamp and voltage clamp recordings are analyzed in the light of new methods allowing us (1) to increase the visibility of inhibitory input, and (2) to continuously measure the visually evoked dynamics of input conductances. We conclude that there exists a diversity of synaptic input combinations generating the same profile of spike-based orientation selectivity, and that this diversity most likely reflects anatomical non-homogeneities in input sampling provided by the local context of the columnar and lateral intracortical network in which the considered cortical cell is embedded.},

Neurophysiol. 88: 2530-2546, 2002. Information is integrated across the visual field to transform local features into a global percept. We now know that V1 neurons provide more spatial integration than originally thought due to the existence of their nonclassical inhibitory surrounds. To understand spatial integration in the visual cortex, we have studied the nature and extent of center and surround influences on neuronal response. We used drifting sinusoidal gratings in circular and annular apertures to estimate the sizes of the receptive field's excitatory center and suppressive surround. We used combinations of stimuli inside and outside the receptive field to explore the nature of the surround influence on the receptive field center as a function of the relative and absolute contrast of stimuli in the two regions. We conclude that the interaction is best explained as a divisive modulation of response gain by signals from the surround. We then develop a receptive field model based on the ratio of signals from Gaussian-shaped center and surround mechanisms. We show that this model can account well for the variations in receptive field size with contrast that we and others have observed and for variations in size with the state of contrast adaptation. The model achieves this success by simple variations in the relative gain of the two component mechanisms of the receptive field. This model thus offers a parsimonious explanation of a variety of phenomena involving changes in apparent receptive field size and accounts for these phenomena purely in terms of two receptive field mechanisms that do not themselves change in size. We used the extent of the center mechanism in our model as an indicator of the spatial extent of the central excitatory portion of the receptive field. We compared the extent of the center to measurements of horizontal connections within V1 and determined that horizontal intracortical connections are well matched in extent to the receptive field center mechanism. Input to the suppressive surround may come in part from feedback signals from higher areas.},

	Abstract = {The existence and location of a human counterpart of macaque visual area V4 are disputed. To resolve this issue, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to obtain topographic maps from human subjects, using visual stimuli and tasks designed to maximize accuracy of topographic maps of the fovea and parafovea and to measure the effects of attention on topographic maps. We identified multiple topographic transitions, each clearly visible in > or = 75% of the maps, that we interpret as boundaries of distinct cortical regions. We call two of these regions dorsal V4 and ventral V4 (together comprising human area V4) because they share several defining characteristics with the macaque regions V4d and V4v (which together comprise macaque area V4). Ventral V4 is adjacent to V3v, and dorsal V4 is adjacent to parafoveal V3d. Ventral V4 and dorsal V4 meet in the foveal confluence shared by V1, V2, and V3. Ventral V4 and dorsal V4 represent complementary regions of the visual field, because ventral V4 represents the upper field and a subregion of the lower field, whereas dorsal V4 represents lower-field locations that are not represented by ventral V4. Finally, attentional modulation of spatial tuning is similar across dorsal and ventral V4, but attention has a smaller effect in V3d and V3v and a larger effect in a neighboring lateral occipital region.},

	Abstract = {Sensory experience can reorganize cortical sensory representations in an epoch of early development. During this period, cortical sensory neurons may shift their response selectivity and become tuned to more frequently occurring stimuli. Although this enlarged cortical representation is believed to underlie improved sensory processing of the experienced stimuli, its precise perceptual consequences are still unknown. We show that rearing rats in a single-frequency tonal environment results in enlarged cortical representations of the frequencies near that of the experienced tone, but the animals are impaired in perceptual discrimination of the over-represented frequencies. By contrast, discrimination of the neighboring under-represented frequencies is substantially improved. Computational analysis indicated that the altered perceptual ability could be fully accounted for by the sound exposure-induced reorganization of cortical primary auditory representations. These results indicate that early experience shapes sensory perception. The same plasticity processes may be important in optimizing phonemic representations in humans.},

	Abstract = {The frontal eye field (FEF) is one of several cortical regions thought to modulate sensory inputs. Moreover, several hypotheses suggest that the FEF can only modulate early visual areas in the presence of a visual stimulus. To test for bottom-up gating of frontal signals, we microstimulated subregions in the FEF of two monkeys and measured the effects throughout the brain with functional magnetic resonance imaging. The activity of higher-order visual areas was strongly modulated by FEF stimulation, independent of visual stimulation. In contrast, FEF stimulation induced a topographically specific pattern of enhancement and suppression in early visual areas, but only in the presence of a visual stimulus. Modulation strength depended on stimulus contrast and on the presence of distractors. We conclude that bottom-up activation is needed to enable top-down modulation of early visual cortex and that stimulus saliency determines the strength of this modulation.},

	Abstract = {Humans can experience aftereffects from oriented stimuli that are not consciously perceived, suggesting that such stimuli receive cortical processing. Determining the physiological substrate of such effects has proven elusive owing to the low spatial resolution of conventional human neuroimaging techniques compared to the size of orientation columns in visual cortex. Here we show that even at conventional resolutions it is possible to use fMRI to obtain a direct measure of orientation-selective processing in V1. We found that many parts of V1 show subtle but reproducible biases to oriented stimuli, and that we could accumulate this information across the whole of V1 using multivariate pattern recognition. Using this information, we could then successfully predict which one of two oriented stimuli a participant was viewing, even when masking rendered that stimulus invisible. Our findings show that conventional fMRI can be used to reveal feature-selective processing in human cortex, even for invisible stimuli.},

@article{polat1998a,
	Abstract = {Neurons in the primary visual cortex are selective for the size, orientation and direction of motion of patterns falling within a restricted region of visual space known as the receptive field. The response to stimuli presented within the receptive field can be facilitated or suppressed by other stimuli falling outside the receptive field which, when presented in isolation, fail to activate the cell. Whether this interaction is facilitative or suppressive depends on the relative orientation of pattern elements inside and outside the receptive field. Here we show that neuronal facilitation preferentially occurs when a near-threshold stimulus inside the receptive field is flanked by higher-contrast, collinear elements located in surrounding regions of visual space. Collinear flanks and orthogonally oriented flanks, however, both act to reduce the response to high-contrast stimuli presented within the receptive field. The observed pattern of facilitation and suppression may be the cellular basis for the observation in humans that the detectability of an oriented pattern is enhanced by collinear flanking elements. Modulation of neuronal responses by stimuli falling outside their receptive fields may thus represent an early neural mechanism for encoding objects and enhancing their perceptual saliency.},

	Abstract = {Nearly 40 years ago, in the pages of this journal, Hubel and Wiesel provided the first description of receptive fields in the primary visual cortex of higher mammals. They defined two classes of cortical cells, "simple" and "complex", based on neural responses to simple visual stimuli. The notion of a hierarchy of receptive fields, where increasingly intricate receptive fields are constructed from more elementary ones, was introduced. Since those early days we have witnessed the birth of quantitative methods to map receptive fields and mathematical descriptions of simple and complex cell function. Insights gained from these models, along with new theoretical concepts, are refining our understanding of receptive field structure and the underlying cortical circuitry. Here, I provide a brief historical account of the evolution of receptive field mapping in visual cortex along with the associated conceptual advancements, and speculate on the shape novel theories of the cortex may take as a result these measurements.},

	Abstract = {The important visual stimulus parameters for a given cell are defined by the classical receptive field (CRF). However, cells are also influenced by visual stimuli presented in areas surrounding the CRF. The experiments described here were conducted to determine the incidence and nature of CRF surround influences in the primary visual cortex. From extracellular recordings in the cat's striate cortex, we find that for over half of the cells investigated (56%, 153/271), the effect of stimulation in the surround of the CRF is to suppress the neuron's activity by at least 10% compared to the response to a grating presented within the CRF alone. For the remainder of the cells, the interactions were minimal and a few were of a facilitatory nature. In this paper, we focus on the suppressive interactions. Simple and complex cell types exhibit equal incidences of surround suppression. Suppression is observed for cells in all layers, and its degree is strongly correlated between the two eyes for binocular neurons. These results show that surround suppression is a prevalent form of inhibition and may play an important role in visual processing.},

@article{onat2007a,
	Abstract = {In everyday life, our brains decide about the relevance of huge amounts of sensory input. Further complicating this situation, this input is distributed over different modalities. This raises the question of how different sources of information interact for the control of overt attention during free exploration of the environment under natural conditions. Different modalities may work independently or interact to determine the consequent overt behavior. To answer this question, we presented natural images and lateralized natural sounds in a variety of conditions and we measured the eye movements of human subjects. We show that, in multimodal conditions, fixation probabilities increase on the side of the image where the sound originates showing that, at a coarser scale, lateralized auditory stimulation topographically increases the salience of the visual field. However, this shift of attention is specific because the probability of fixation of a given location on the side of the sound scales with the saliency of the visual stimulus, meaning that the selection of fixation points during multimodal conditions is dependent on the saliencies of both auditory and visual stimuli. Further analysis shows that a linear combination of both unimodal saliencies provides a good model for this integration process, which is optimal according to information-theoretical criteria. Our results support a functional joint saliency map, which integrates different unimodal saliencies before any decision is taken about the subsequent fixation point. These results provide guidelines for the performance and architecture of any model of overt attention that deals with more than one modality.},

	Abstract = {1. To investigate the effects of iopanoic acid (IA) and carbimazole on increased activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in hyperthyroidism, we studied 14 women with hyperthyroidism caused by Graves' disease (n + 11) or toxic multinodular goitre (n + 3) before and after carbimazole or IA treatment. Seven normal women comprised the control group. 2. Changes in thyroid-stimulating hormone, total and free thyroid hormones, arginine vasopressin (AVP), urinary free cortisol, adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH) and cortisol in response to human corticotrophin-releasing hormone (hCRH; 100 microg, i.v.) were estimated under basal conditions and after treatment with IA (3 g/day; n + 7) for 7 days or carbimazole (30 mg/day; n + 7) for 1 month. 3. A higher ACTH response, with normal cortisol secretion, was observed in hyperthyroid patients in response to hCRH compared with the control group. After 7 days treatment, IA induced a significant reduction in total tri-iodothyronine (T(3)) and free T(3) to normal levels and a stronger ACTH response to hCRH, whereas plasma and urinary cortisol levels remained unchanged. Patients treated with carbimazole showed normalization of thyroid hormone levels, a reduction in basal and stimulated ACTH secretion and higher urinary free cortisol levels compared with pretreatment levels. Neither IA nor carbimazole treatment had any effect on AVP levels in hyperthyroid patients. 4. In conclusion, hyperthyroid patients showed HPA axis hyperactivity of central origin with reduced cortisol responses, which were reversed by carbimazole treatment. The differential effects of IA and carbimazole on HPA function indicate that thyroid hormones have a role in modulation of the HPA axis.},

@article{dean2008a,
	Abstract = {Auditory neurons must represent accurately a wide range of sound levels using firing rates that vary over a far narrower range of levels. Recently, we demonstrated that this "dynamic range problem" is lessened by neural adaptation, whereby neurons adjust their input-output functions for sound level according to the prevailing distribution of levels. These adjustments in input-output functions increase the accuracy with which levels around those occurring most commonly are coded by the neural population. Here, we examine how quickly this adaptation occurs. We recorded from single neurons in the auditory midbrain during a stimulus that switched repeatedly between two distributions of sound levels differing in mean level. The high-resolution analysis afforded by this stimulus showed that a prominent component of the adaptation occurs rapidly, with an average time constant across neurons of 160 ms after an increase in mean level, much faster than our previous experiments were able to assess. This time course appears to be independent of both the timescale over which sound levels varied and that over which sound level distributions varied, but is related to neural characteristic frequency. We find that adaptation to an increase in mean level occurs more rapidly than to a decrease. Finally, we observe an additional, slow adaptation in some neurons, which occurs over a timescale of tens of seconds. Our findings provide constraints in the search for mechanisms underlying adaptation to sound level. They also have functional implications for the role of adaptation in the representation of natural sounds.},

	Abstract = {Neurons in visual cortex are linked by an extensive network of lateral connections. To study the effect of these connections on neural responses, we recorded spikes and local field potentials (LFPs) from multi-electrode arrays that were implanted in monkey and cat primary visual cortex. Spikes at each location generated outward traveling LFP waves. When the visual stimulus was absent or had low contrast, these LFP waves had large amplitudes and traveled over long distances. Their effect was strong: LFP traces at any site could be predicted by the superposition of waves that were evoked by spiking in a approximately 1.5-mm radius. As stimulus contrast increased, both the magnitude and the distance traveled by the waves progressively decreased. We conclude that the relative weight of feedforward and lateral inputs in visual cortex is not fixed, but rather depends on stimulus contrast. Lateral connections dominate at low contrast, when spatial integration of signals is perhaps most beneficial.},

Michelson contrast sensitivity was better for gratings than for noise stimuli or spots, whereas RMS contrast sensitivity was almost equal for gratings and noise stimuli but lowest for spots.

	Abstract = {Natural scene coding in ferret visual cortex was investigated using a new technique for multi-site recording of neuronal activity from the cortical surface. Surface recordings accurately reflected radially aligned layer 2/3 activity. At individual sites, evoked activity to natural scenes was weakly correlated with the local image contrast structure falling within the cells' classical receptive field. However, a population code, derived from activity integrated across cortical sites having retinotopically overlapping receptive fields, correlated strongly with the local image contrast structure. Cell responses demonstrated high lifetime sparseness, population sparseness, and high dispersal values, implying efficient neural coding in terms of information processing. These results indicate that while cells at an individual cortical site do not provide a reliable estimate of the local contrast structure in natural scenes, cell activity integrated across distributed cortical sites is closely related to this structure in the form of a sparse and dispersed code.},

	Abstract = {Functional imaging studies of olfaction have consistently reported odorant-induced activation of the cerebellum. However, the cerebellar role in olfaction remains unknown. We examined the olfactory and olfactomotor abilities of patients with unilateral cerebellar lesions, comparing performance within subjects across nostrils, as well as between subjects with age-matched and young controls. Regarding olfactory performance, initial testing revealed that patients had a contralesional impairment in olfactory identification but not olfactory detection threshold. However, when tested under conditions that prevented compensatory sniffing strategies, the patients also exhibited a contralesional olfactory detection impairment. Regarding olfactomotor function, a healthy olfactomotor system generates sniffs that are (1) sufficiently vigorous and (2) inversely proportional to odorant concentration in sniff mean airflow velocity, maximum airflow velocity, volume, and duration. Patients' sniffs were lower in overall airflow velocity and volume in comparison with control participants. Furthermore, reduced sniff velocity predicted poorer detection thresholds in patients. Finally, whereas young controls used concentration-dependent sniffs, there was a trend in that direction only for age-matched controls. Patients used sniffs that were concentration invariant. In conclusion, cerebellar lesions impacted olfactory and olfactomotor performance. These findings strongly implicate an olfactocerebellar pathway prominent in odor identification and detection that functionally connects each nostril primarily to the contralateral cerebellum.},

	Abstract = {Intersensory temporal synchrony is an ubiquitous sensory attribute that has proven to be critical for binding multisensory inputs, sometimes erroneously leading to dramatic perceptual illusions. However, little is known about how the brain detects temporal synchrony between multimodal sensory inputs. We used positron emission tomography to demonstrate that detecting auditory-visual stimulus onset asynchrony activates a large-scale neural network of insular, posterior parietal, prefrontal, and cerebellar areas with the highest and task-specific activity localized to the right insula. Interregional covariance analysis further showed significant task-related functional interactions between the insula, the posterior thalamus, and superior colliculus. Based on these results and the available electrophysiological and anatomical connectivity data in animals, we propose that the insula, via its known short-latency connections with the tectal system, mediates temporally defined auditory-visual interaction at an early stage of cortical processing permitting phenomena such as the ventriloquist and the McGurk illusions.},

	Abstract = {Recent anatomical, physiological, and neuroimaging findings indicate multisensory convergence at early, putatively unisensory stages of cortical processing. The objective of this study was to confirm somatosensory-auditory interaction in A1 and to define both its physiological mechanisms and its consequences for auditory information processing. Laminar current source density and multiunit activity sampled during multielectrode penetrations of primary auditory area A1 in awake macaques revealed clear somatosensory-auditory interactions, with a novel mechanism: somatosensory inputs appear to reset the phase of ongoing neuronal oscillations, so that accompanying auditory inputs arrive during an ideal, high-excitability phase, and produce amplified neuronal responses. In contrast, responses to auditory inputs arriving during the opposing low-excitability phase tend to be suppressed. Our findings underscore the instrumental role of neuronal oscillations in cortical operations. The timing and laminar profile of the multisensory interactions in A1 indicate that nonspecific thalamic systems may play a key role in the effect.},

	Abstract = {Whereas gamma-band neuronal oscillations clearly appear integral to visual attention, the role of lower-frequency oscillations is still being debated. Mounting evidence indicates that a key functional property of these oscillations is the rhythmic shifting of excitability in local neuronal ensembles. Here, we show that when attended stimuli are in a rhythmic stream, delta-band oscillations in the primary visual cortex entrain to the rhythm of the stream, resulting in increased response gain for task-relevant events and decreased reaction times. Because of hierarchical cross-frequency coupling, delta phase also determines momentary power in higher-frequency activity. These instrumental functions of low-frequency oscillations support a conceptual framework that integrates numerous earlier findings.},

	Abstract = {A broad range of evidence regarding the functional organization of the vertebrate brain - spanning from comparative neurology to experimental psychology and neurophysiology to clinical data - is reviewed for its bearing on conceptions of the neural organization of consciousness. A novel principle relating target selection, action selection, and motivation to one another, as a means to optimize integration for action in real time, is introduced. With its help, the principal macrosystems of the vertebrate brain can be seen to form a centralized functional design in which an upper brain stem system organized for conscious function performs a penultimate step in action control. This upper brain stem system retained a key role throughout the evolutionary process by which an expanding forebrain - culminating in the cerebral cortex of mammals - came to serve as a medium for the elaboration of conscious contents. This highly conserved upper brainstem system, which extends from the roof of the midbrain to the basal diencephalon, integrates the massively parallel and distributed information capacity of the cerebral hemispheres into the limited-capacity, sequential mode of operation required for coherent behavior. It maintains special connective relations with cortical territories implicated in attentional and conscious functions, but is not rendered nonfunctional in the absence of cortical input. This helps explain the purposive, goal-directed behavior exhibited by mammals after experimental decortication, as well as the evidence that children born without a cortex are conscious. Taken together these circumstances suggest that brainstem mechanisms are integral to the constitution of the conscious state, and that an adequate account of neural mechanisms of conscious function cannot be confined to the thalamocortical complex alone.},

	Abstract = {Our brain integrates the information provided by the different sensory modalities into a coherent percept, and recent studies suggest that this process is not restricted to higher association areas. Here we evaluate the hypothesis that auditory cortical fields are involved in cross-modal processing by probing individual neurons for audiovisual interactions. We find that visual stimuli modulate auditory processing both at the level of field potentials and single-unit activity and already in primary and secondary auditory fields. These interactions strongly depend on a stimulus' efficacy in driving the neurons but occur independently of stimulus category and for naturalistic as well as artificial stimuli. In addition, interactions are sensitive to the relative timing of audiovisual stimuli and are strongest when visual stimuli lead by 20-80 msec. Exploring the underlying mechanisms, we find that enhancement correlates with the resetting of slow (approximately 10 Hz) oscillations to a phase angle of optimal excitability. These results demonstrate that visual stimuli can modulate the firing of neurons in auditory cortex in a manner that depends on stimulus efficacy and timing. These neurons thus meet the criteria for sensory integration and provide the auditory modality with multisensory contextual information about co-occurring environmental events.},

Each filter response is then rectified and divided by a weighted sum of rectified responses of neighboring filters. We show that this decomposition, with parameters optimized for the statistics of a generic ensemble of natural images or sounds, provides a good characterization of the nonlinear response properties of typical neurons in primary visual cortex or auditory nerve, respectively. These results suggest that nonlinear response properties of sensory neurons are not an accident of biological implementation, but have an important functional role.},

	Abstract = {The purpose of the present experiment was to investigate the integration of sequences of visual and tactile events. Subjects were presented with sequences of visual flashes and tactile taps simultaneously and instructed to count either the flashes (Session 1) or the taps (Session 2). The number of flashes could differ from the number of taps by +/-1. For both sessions, the perceived number of events was significantly influenced by the number of events presented in the task-irrelevant modality. Touch had a stronger influence on vision than vision on touch. Interestingly, touch was the more reliable of the two modalities-less variable estimates when presented alone. For both sessions, the perceptual estimates were less variable when stimuli were presented in both modalities than when the task-relevant modality was presented alone. These results indicate that even when one signal is explicitly task irrelevant, sensory information tends to be automatically integrated across modalities. They also suggest that the relative weight of each sensory channel in the integration process depends on its relative reliability. The results are described using a Bayesian probabilistic model for multimodal integration that accounts for the coupling between the sensory estimates.},

	Abstract = {Visual scanning of face images is widely reported to be abnormal in schizophrenia. This impaired processing has been proposed to be partly responsible for patients' disturbance in social interactions. The present study was designed to determine whether abnormal scanning is specific to images with social content or extends to other types of stimuli. Individuals with schizophrenia (n=22), bipolar disorder (n=19) and healthy controls (n=37) were asked to view a series of 28 images with or without socially important content (i.e. faces, landscapes, fractals and noise patterns) while their eye movements were recorded video-oculographically. Temporal and spatial characteristics of scan paths were compared for each patient group and picture type. Independent of image content, patients with schizophrenia exhibited fewer fixations, longer fixation duration, longer saccade duration and peak velocity, and smaller saccade amplitude compared with healthy controls. Patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder did not differ significantly from one another on any of the temporal variables recorded. Fixation location distributions of participants with schizophrenia differed significantly from that of healthy controls on all picture types and from patients with bipolar disorder on all but face images. Abnormal scanning in schizophrenia and also bipolar disorder was independent of stimulus type and therefore reflects a global visual scanning impairment not specific to faces. Spatial scanning characteristics but not temporal ones may serve as biomarkers in the functional psychoses.},

	Abstract = {Working memory has been linked to elevated single neuron discharge in monkeys and to oscillatory changes in the human EEG, but the relation between these effects has remained largely unexplored. We addressed this question by measuring local field potentials and single unit activity simultaneously from multiple electrodes placed in extrastriate visual cortex while monkeys were performing a working memory task. We describe a significant enhancement in theta band energy during the delay period. Theta oscillations had a systematic effect on single neuron activity, with neurons emitting more action potentials near their preferred angle of each theta cycle. Sample-selective delay activity was enhanced if only action potentials emitted near the preferred theta angle were considered. Our results suggest that extrastriate visual cortex is involved in short-term maintenance of information and that theta oscillations provide a mechanism for structuring the recurrent interaction between neurons in different brain regions that underlie working memory.},

Here, we use a unique, large-scale multielectrode array to demonstrate that DSGCs are present at eye opening, in mice that have been reared in darkness and in mice that lack cholinergic retinal waves. These data suggest that direction selectivity in the retina is established largely independent of patterned activity and is therefore likely to emerge as a result of complex molecular interactions.},

	Abstract = {Monkeys can learn to directly control the movements of an artificial actuator by using a brain-machine interface (BMI) driven by the activity of a sample of cortical neurons. Eventually, they can do so without moving their limbs. Neuronal adaptations underlying the transition from control of the limb to control of the actuator are poorly understood. Here, we show that rapid modifications in neuronal representation of velocity of the hand and actuator occur in multiple cortical areas during the operation of a BMI. Initially, monkeys controlled the actuator by moving a hand-held pole. During this period, the BMI was trained to predict the actuator velocity. As the monkeys started using their cortical activity to control the actuator, the activity of individual neurons and neuronal populations became less representative of the animal's hand movements while representing the movements of the actuator. As a result of this adaptation, the animals could eventually stop moving their hands yet continue to control the actuator. These results show that, during BMI control, cortical ensembles represent behaviorally significant motor parameters, even if these are not associated with movements of the animal's own limb.},

	Abstract = {We investigated the effect of image size on saccade amplitudes. First, in a meta-analysis, relevant results from previous scene perception studies are summarised, suggesting the possibility of a linear relationship between mean saccade amplitude and image size. Forty-eight observers viewed 96 colour scene images scaled to four different sizes, while their eye movements were recorded. Mean and median saccade amplitudes were found to be directly proportional to image size, while the mode of the distribution lay in the range of very short saccades. However, saccade amplitudes expressed as percentages of image size were not constant over the different image sizes; on smaller stimulus images, the relative saccades were found to be larger, and vice versa. In sum, and as far as mean and median saccade amplitudes are concerned, the size of stimulus images is the dominant factor. Other factors, such as image properties, viewing task, or measurement equipment, are only of subordinate importance. Thus, the role of stimulus size has to be reconsidered, in theoretical as well as methodological terms.},

	Abstract = {The retinotopic organization of cat cortex, in the vicinity of areas 20 and 21 as defined by Heath and Jones ('71), was determined using electrophysiological mapping techniques. Although the topography of the visual field representations in this region of cortex is more complex than that found in areas 17, 18, and 19, this region appears to contain four representations of the visual hemifield. The four cortical areas these visual field representations occupy have been labeled 20a, 20b, 21a, 21b. These representations are not as precise as those found in areas 17, 18, and 19; the receptive fields in areas 20a, 20b, 21a, and 21b are larger and there is more scatter in receptive field location among adjacent cells. The upper visual hemifield is emphasized in all four of these areas, but the extent of the representation ranges from just the central 20 degrees found in area 21a to nearly the entire upper visual quadrant found in area 20b. The peak areal magnification factors found in these areas are all at least one order of magnitude less than those found in area 17. The visual field transformations from retina onto cortex in areas 20a, 20b, 21a, and 21b are similar to the types we found in other cortical visual areas, and the significance of these transformations for visual processing is discussed.},

	Abstract = {Thyroid hormone synthesis, metabolism and action require adequate availability of the essential trace elements iodine and selenium, which affect homeostasis of thyroid hormone-dependent metabolic pathways. The three selenocysteine-containing iodothyronine deiodinases constitute a novel gene family. Selenium is retained and deiodinase expression is maintained at almost normal levels in the thyroid gland, the brain and several other endocrine tissues during selenium deficiency, thus guaranteeing adequate local and systemic levels of the active thyroid hormone T(3). Due to their low tissue concentrations and their mRNA SECIS elements deiodinases rank high in the cellular and tissue-specific hierarchy of selenium distribution among various selenoproteins. While systemic selenium status and expression of abundant selenoproteins (glutathione peroxidase or selenoprotein P) is already impaired in patients with cancer, disturbed gastrointestinal resorption, unbalanced nutrition or patients requiring intensive care treatment, selenium-dependent deiodinase function might still be adequate. However, disease-associated alterations in proinflammatory cytokines, growth factors, hormones and pharmaceuticals modulate deiodinase isoenzyme expression independent from altered selenium status and might thus pretend causal relationships between systemic selenium status and altered thyroid hormone metabolism. Limited or inadequate supply of both trace elements, iodine and selenium, leads to complex rearrangements of thyroid hormone metabolism enabling adaptation to unfavorable conditions.},

Here we demonstrate non-spatial, feature-based attentional modulation of visual motion processing, and show that attention increases the gain of direction-selective neurons in visual cortical area MT without narrowing the direction-tuning curves. These findings place important constraints on the neural mechanisms of attention and we propose to unify the effects of spatial location, direction of motion and other features of the attended stimuli in a 'feature similarity gain model' of attention.},

	Abstract = {The role of the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeN) in modulating output of noradrenaline in the forebrain was evaluated by recording extracellular, single-unit activity from the noradrenergic nucleus locus ceruleus (LC) during stimulation of the CeN. Short high-frequency trains (200 Hz) delivered at 800 microA in the CeN evoked phasic responses in 90% of the neurons recorded in LC. Single pulses were also effective but less reliably. The responses were complex, multiphasic with an initial latency of 10-20 msec. This early peak was diminished or, in some cases, completely blocked by local or intracerebroventricular application of the corticotrophin releasing factor antagonist alpha helical CRF (9-41). The later excitatory peak and subsequent inhibition were not effected by the drug treatment. The results underline the reciprocal functional relationship between the amygdaloid complex and the LC and suggest that the LC might be an important "effector" of CeN activation during learning.},

	Abstract = {Weighted salience models are a popular framework for image-driven visual attentional processes. These models operate by: sampling the visual environment; calculating feature maps; combining them in a weighted sum and using this to determine where the eye will fixate next. We examine these stages in turn. We find that a biologically plausible non-uniform retinal sampling causes feature coding unreliability. The linear weighted sum operation seems an adequate model if statistical feature dimension dependencies are considered. Using signal detection theory we find good discrimination between targets and non-targets in the weighted sum, but the fixation criterion of 'peak salience' is suboptimal.},

	Abstract = {Recently, statistical models of natural images have shown the emergence of several properties of the visual cortex. Most models have considered the nongaussian properties of static image patches, leading to sparse coding or independent component analysis. Here we consider the basic time dependencies of image sequences instead of their nongaussianity. We show that simple-cell-type receptive fields emerge when temporal response strength correlation is maximized for natural image sequences. Thus, temporal response strength correlation, which is a nonlinear measure of temporal coherence, provides an alternative to sparseness in modeling simple-cell receptive field properties. Our results also suggest an interpretation of simple cells in terms of invariant coding principles, which have previously been used to explain complex-cell receptive fields.},

@article{wade2003a,
	Abstract = {Dodge, in 1916, suggested that the French term 'saccade' should be used for describing the rapid movements of the eyes that occur while reading. Previously he had referred to these as type I movements. Javal had used the term 'saccade' in 1879, when describing experiments conducted in his laboratory by Lamare. Accordingly, Javal has been rightly credited with assigning the term to rapid eye movements. In English these rapid rotations had been called jerks, and they had been observed and measured before Lamare's studies of reading. Rapid sweeps of the eyes occur as one phase of nystagmus; they were observed by Wells in 1792 who used an afterimage technique, and they were illustrated by Crum Brown in 1878. Afterimages were used in nineteenth-century research on eye movements and eye position; they were also employed by Hering in 1879, to ascertain how the eyes moved during reading. In the previous year, Javal had employed afterimages in his investigations of reading, but this was to demonstrate that the eyes moved horizontally rather than vertically. Hering's and Lamare's auditory method established the discontinuous nature of eye movements during reading, and the photographic methods introduced by Dodge and others in the early twentieth century enabled their characteristics to be determined with greater accuracy.},

	Abstract = {Neuronal interactions are an intricate part of cortical information processing generating internal representations of the environment beyond simple one-to-one mappings of the input parameter space. Here we examined functional ranges of interaction processes within ensembles of neurons in cat primary visual cortex. Seven "elementary" stimuli consisting of small squares of light were presented at contiguous horizontal positions. The population representation of these stimuli was compared to the representation of "composite" stimuli, consisting of two squares of light at varied separations. Based on receptive field measurements and by application of an Optimal Linear Estimator, the representation of retinal location was constructed as a distribution of population activation (DPA) in visual space. The spatiotemporal pattern of the DPA was investigated by obtaining the activity of each neuron for a sequence of time intervals. We found that the DPA of composite stimuli deviates from the superposition of its components because of distance-dependent (1) early excitation and (2) late inhibition. (3) The shape of the DPA of composite stimuli revealed a distance-dependent repulsion effect. We simulated these findings within the framework of dynamic neural fields. In the model, the feedforward response of neurons is modulated by spatial ranges of excitatory and inhibitory interactions within the population. A single set of model parameters was sufficient to describe the main experimental effects. Combined, our results indicate that the spatiotemporal processing of visual stimuli is characterized by a delicate, mutual interplay between stimulus-dependent and interaction-based strategies contributing to the formation of widespread cortical activation patterns.},

The Himba showed a local bias stronger than that has been previously observed in any other non-clinical human population. However, in Experiment 2, their recognition of normal or distorted ("Thatcherized") faces did not appear to have been affected by their attention to detail as has been suggested for autistic populations. The data are consistent with a cultural/experiential origin for population differences in local processing and suggest that attention to the local and global properties of stimuli may differ for hierarchical figures and faces.},

	Abstract = {The receptive field of a visual neurone is classically defined as the region of space (or retina) where a visual stimulus evokes a change in its firing activity. Intracellular recordings in cat area 17 show that the visually evoked synaptic integration field extends over a much larger area than that established on the basis of spike activity. Synaptic depolarizing (dominant excitation) responses decrease in strength for stimuli that are flashed at increasing distances away from the centre of the discharge field, while their onset latency increases. A detailed spatio-temporal analysis of these electrophysiological data shows that subthreshold synaptic responses observed in the 'silent' surround of cortical receptive fields result from the intracortical spread of activation waves carried by slowly conducting horizontal axons within primary visual cortex. They also predict that a perceptual facilitation may occur when feedforward activation produced by the motion signal in the retina travels in phase in the primary visual cortex with the visually induced spread of horizontal activation. A psychophysical correlate has been obtained in humans, showing that apparent motion produced by a sequence of co-linear Gabor patches, known to preferentially activate V1 orientation selective cells, are perceived by human observers as much faster than non co-linear sequences of the same physical speed.},

	Abstract = {Context: Graves' disease is an autoimmune disease of the thyroid gland. Patients often have affective and cognitive complaints, whether these disappear after treatment remains disputed. Objective: Evaluate cerebral biochemistry in acute and treated Graves' disease. Design: Prospective, investigating volunteers once and patients pre - and one year post treatment. Setting: The study was performed at a radiology department, a memory disorder- and two endocrinology clinics. Patients and other participants: Out of 53 consecutively referred, newly diagnosed, and untreated patients with Graves' thyrotoxicosis. 27 patients (34+/-8 years) and 33 matched volunteers were included. Interventions: Thionamide treatment. Main outcome measures: Brain metabolite concentrations. Methods: Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the brain and a battery of biochemical, affective and cognitive tests. Results: Previously reported findings of reduced choline and myo-inositol in acute Graves' disease were confirmed and reversibility was demonstrated. Parieto-occipital white matter glutamine was and remained significantly reduced (p<0.01). Acute phase parieto-occipital white matter total choline correlated significantly (r=-0.57;p<0.01) with impaired thyroid function. Pre-treatment total triiodothyronine predicted post-treatment occipital gray matter glutamine (r=-0.52;p<0.01). Occipital gray matter total choline (r=-0.53;p<0.01) and parieto-occipital white matter glutamate (r=-0.54;p<0.01) correlated with initial values of selected attention and concentration cognitive scores and predicted them at follow-up. Conclusions: The persistent reduction of glutamine in white matter, the decreasing glutamate in occipital gray matter and the correlation with severity of the initial disease as well as with attention and concentration cognitive scores indicated that there was a persistent and possibly progressive disturbance of the glutamate glutamine cycling in Graves' Disease.},

	Abstract = {When attention is directed to a location in the visual field, sensitivity to stimuli at that location is increased. At the neuronal level, this could arise either through a multiplicative increase in firing rate or through an increase in the effective strength of the stimulus. To test conflicting predictions of these alternative models, we recorded responses of V4 neurons to stimuli across a range of luminance contrasts and measured the change in response when monkeys attended to them in order to discriminate a target stimulus from nontargets. Attention caused greater increases in response at low contrast than at high contrast, consistent with an increase in effective stimulus strength. On average, attention increased the effective contrast of the attended stimulus by a factor of 1.51, an increase of 51% of its physical contrast.},

	Abstract = {The classification of cat retinal ganglion cells as X or Y on the basis of linearity or nonlinearity of spatial summation has been confirmed and extended. Recordings were taken from optic tract fibres of anaesthetized, paralysed cats. 2. When an alternating phase sine wave grating was used as a stimulus, X cells had null positions and Y cells responded at all positions of the grating. 3. These results did not depend on the temporal wave form or the temporal frequency of pattern alternation over a wide range. 4. At high spatial frequencies for the particular cell, a Y cell gave abig 'on-off' response, or frequency doubling, at all positions of the grating, while an X cell did not. 5. The use of contrast sensitivity versus spatial phase also served to differentiate the two cell types. With an alternating sine grating stimulus X cells had a sinusoidal dependence on spatial phase, while each Y cell's sensitivity depended in a complicated manner on spatial phase. 6. Sensitivity versus spatial phase for different Fourier components of the neural response also separated the two classes of cells. Significant second harmonic distortion was present in Y cells. The second harmonic component was spatial phase insensitive, and became dominant at high spatial frequencies. 7. The maximum of the 2nd/1st harmonic ratio was taken as an index of nonlinearity. X cells always had a nonlinearity index less than 1 while in Y cells this index always exceeded 1. 8. Response to spots, diffuse light and drifting gratings were compared to the nonlinearity index as a basis for classifying cells. The nonlinearity index was most reliable because it was least dependent on retinal eccentricity.},

	Abstract = {The superficial layers of primary visual cortex, unlike layer 4, have an extensive network of long-range horizontal connections linking sites of similar orientation preference. To identify possible functional consequences of this distinct anatomy, we compared the receptive field properties of layers 2/3 and 4 neurons in tree shrew primary visual cortex with electrophysiological recordings. We found that elongated receptive fields, strong orientation tuning, and length summation (properties predicted by the anatomy of the horizontal connections) are present in layer 2/3 neurons, but not in layer 4 neurons. We further characterized the summation fields of layer 2/3 neurons and found axis and orientation-specific facilitation that matched the distribution of horizontal connections. The functional signature of horizontal connections was also evident in the population response of layer 2/3 neurons; the intrinsic signal activation pattern elicited by an array of collinear Gabor elements was significantly stronger than that elicited by a noncollinear array. Furthermore, our results showed that this enhancement of population response was achieved without compromising spatial resolution along the collinear axis, providing stimulus-specific facilitation without filling in between stimuli. Taken together, these results suggest that horizontal connections play a significant role in shaping the visual responses of layer 2/3 neurons.},

	Abstract = {The mammalian visual system is one of the most intensively investigated sensory systems. However, our knowledge of the typical input it is operating on is surprisingly limited. To address this issue, we seek to learn about the natural visual environment and the world as seen by a cat. With a CCD camera attached to their head, cats explore several outdoor environments and videos of natural stimuli are recorded from the animals' perspective. The statistical analysis of these videos reveals several remarkable properties. First, we find an anisotropy of oriented contours with an enhanced occurrence of horizontal orientations, earlier described in the "oblique effect" as a predominance of the two cardinal orientations. Second, contrast is not elevated in the center of the images, suggesting different mechanisms of fixation point selection as compared to humans. Third, analyzing a sequence of images we find that the precise position of contours varies faster than their orientation. Finally, collinear contours prevail over parallel shifted contours, matching recent physiological and anatomical results. These findings demonstrate the rich structure of natural visual stimuli and its direct relation to extensively studied anatomical and physiological issues.},

	Abstract = {We have shown previously the existence of small, activity-dependent changes in intrinsic optical properties of cortex that are useful for optical imaging of cortical functional architecture. In this study we introduce a higher resolution optical imaging system that offers spatial and temporal resolution exceeding that achieved by most alternative imaging techniques for imaging cortical functional architecture or for monitoring local changes in cerebral blood volume or oxygen saturation. In addition, we investigated the mechanisms responsible for the activity-dependent intrinsic signals evoked by sensory stimuli, and studied their origins and wavelength dependence. These studies enabled high-resolution visualization of cortical functional architecture at wavelengths ranging from 480 to 940 nm. With the use of near-infrared illumination it was possible to image cortical functional architecture through the intact dura or even through a thinned skull. In addition, the same imaging technique proved useful for imaging and discriminating sensory-evoked, activity-dependent changes in local blood volume and oxygen saturation (oxygen delivery). Illumination at 570 nm allowed imaging of activity-dependent blood volume increases, whereas at 600-630 nm, the predominant signal probably originated from activity-dependent oxygen delivery from capillaries. The onset of oxygen delivery started prior to the blood volume increase. Thus, optical imaging based on intrinsic signals is a minimally invasive procedure for monitoring short- and long-term changes in cerebral activity.},

@article{dan1996a,
	Abstract = {A recent computational theory suggests that visual processing in the retina and the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) serves to recode information into an efficient form (Atick and Redlich, 1990). Information theoretic analysis showed that the representation of visual information at the level of the photoreceptors is inefficient, primarily attributable to a high degree of spatial and temporal correlation in natural scenes. It was predicted, therefore, that the retina and the LGN should recode this signal into a decorrelated form or, equivalently, into a signal with a "white" spatial and temporal power spectrum. In the present study, we tested directly the prediction that visual processing at the level of the LGN temporarily whitens the natural visual input. We recorded the responses of individual neurons in the LGN of the cat to natural, time-varying images (movies) and, as a control, to white-noise stimuli. Although there is substantial temporal correlation in natural inputs (Dong and Atick, 1995b), we found that the power spectra of LGN responses were essentially white. Between 3 and 15 Hz, the power of the responses had an average variation of only +/-10.3%. Thus, the signals that the LGN relays to visual cortex are temporarily decorrelated. Furthermore, the responses of X-cells to natural inputs can be well predicted from their responses to white-noise inputs. We therefore conclude that whitening of natural inputs can be explained largely by the linear filtering properties (Enroth-Cugell and Robson, 1966). Our results suggest that the early visual pathway is well adapted for efficient coding of information in the natural visual environment, in agreement with the prediction of the computational theory.},

Single-unit studies have shown that attention to a feature modulates neuronal signals in a range of areas in monkey visual cortex. The location-independent property of feature-based attention makes it particularly well suited to modify selectively the neural representations of stimuli or parts within complex visual scenes that match the currently attended feature.

	Abstract = {Detecting a target in clutter is particularly difficult because the observer must monitor many potential locations to find the target, and because the clutter itself might mask the target. To investigate whether contemporary models of search can account for visual search in clutter, we measured the detection of an oblique string of five aligned dots presented at an unknown location as a function of noise density. Observers judged which of two 200 ms intervals contained the signal string. At a given density, noise composed of oriented pairs of dots greatly degraded detection compared to random dot noise, especially if the paired noise shared the same orientation as the signal. Increasing the orientation difference between the paired noise and the signal improved detection, as did increasing signal length. We successfully modeled these results with an array of multi-scaled oriented detectors optimally tuned for the signal string. These results indicate that search for these simple patterns in noise is based on competing responses in oriented filters.},

	Abstract = {Invariant features of temporally varying signals are useful for analysis and classification. Slow feature analysis (SFA) is a new method for learning invariant or slowly varying features from a vectorial input signal. It is based on a nonlinear expansion of the input signal and application of principal component analysis to this expanded signal and its time derivative. It is guaranteed to find the optimal solution within a family of functions directly and can learn to extract a large number of decorrelated features, which are ordered by their degree of invariance. SFA can be applied hierarchically to process high-dimensional input signals and extract complex features. SFA is applied first to complex cell tuning properties based on simple cell output, including disparity and motion. Then more complicated input-output functions are learned by repeated application of SFA. Finally, a hierarchical network of SFA modules is presented as a simple model of the visual system. The same unstructured network can learn translation, size, rotation, contrast, or, to a lesser degree, illumination invariance for one-dimensional objects, depending on only the training stimulus. Surprisingly, only a few training objects suffice to achieve good generalization to new objects. The generated representation is suitable for object recognition. Performance degrades if the network is trained to learn multiple invariances simultaneously.},

	Abstract = {In several experiments, it was found that global perception of spatial form can arise exclusively from unpredictable but synchronized changes among local features. Within an array of nonoverlapping apertures, contours move in one of two directions, with direction reversing randomly over time. When contours within a region of the array reverse directions in synchrony, they stand out conspicuously from the rest of the array where direction reversals are unsynchronized. Clarity of spatial structure from synchronized change depends on the rate of motion reversal and on the proportion of elements reversing direction in synchrony. Evidently, human vision is sensitive to the rich temporal structure in these stochastic events.},

@article{meredith1986a,
	Abstract = {Convergence of inputs from different sensory modalities onto individual neurons is a phenomenon that occurs widely throughout the brain at many phyletic levels and appears to represent a basic neural mechanism by which an organism integrates complex environmental stimuli. In the present study, neurons in the superior colliculus (SC) were used as a model to examine how single neurons deal with simultaneous cues from different sensory modalities (e.g., visual, auditory, somatosensory). The functional result of multisensory convergence on an individual cell was determined by comparing the responses evoked from it by a combined-modality (multimodal) stimulus with those elicited by each (unimodal) component of that stimulus presented alone. Superior colliculus cells exhibited profound changes in their activity when individual sensory stimuli were combined. These "multisensory interactions" were found to be widespread among deep laminae cells and fell into one of two functional categories: response enhancement, characterized by a significant increase in the number of discharges evoked; and response depression, characterized by a significant decrease in the discharges elicited. Multisensory response interactions most often reflected a multiplicative, rather than summative, change in activity. Their absolute magnitude varied from cell to cell and, when stimulus conditions were altered, within the same cell. However, the percentage change of enhanced interactions was generally inversely related to the vigor of the responses that could be evoked by presenting each unimodal stimulus alone and suggest that the potential for response amplification was greatest when responses evoked by individual stimuli were weakest. The majority of cells exhibiting multi-sensory characteristics were demonstrated to have descending efferent projections and thus had access to premotor and motor areas of the brain stem and spinal cord involved in SC-mediated attentive and orientation behaviors. These data show that multisensory convergence provides the descending efferent cells of the SC with a dynamic response character. The responses of these cells and the SC-mediated behaviors that they underlie need not be immutably tied to the presence of any single stimulus, but can vary in response to the particular complex of stimuli present in the environment at any given moment.},

	Abstract = {Evidence indicates that sleep after learning is critical for the subsequent consolidation of human memory. Whether sleep before learning is equally essential for the initial formation of new memories, however, remains an open question. We report that a single night of sleep deprivation produces a significant deficit in hippocampal activity during episodic memory encoding, resulting in worse subsequent retention. Furthermore, these hippocampal impairments instantiate a different pattern of functional connectivity in basic alertness networks of the brainstem and thalamus. We also find that unique prefrontal regions predict the success of encoding for sleep-deprived individuals relative to those who have slept normally. These results demonstrate that an absence of prior sleep substantially compromises the neural and behavioral capacity for committing new experiences to memory. It therefore appears that sleep before learning is critical in preparing the human brain for next-day memory formation-a worrying finding considering society's increasing erosion of sleep time.},

	Abstract = {Recordings of local field potentials (LFPs) reveal that the sensory cortex displays rhythmic activity and fluctuations over a wide range of frequencies and amplitudes. Yet, the role of this kind of activity in encoding sensory information remains largely unknown. To understand the rules of translation between the structure of sensory stimuli and the fluctuations of cortical responses, we simulated a sparsely connected network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons modeling a local cortical population, and we determined how the LFPs generated by the network encode information about input stimuli. We first considered simple static and periodic stimuli and then naturalistic input stimuli based on electrophysiological recordings from the thalamus of anesthetized monkeys watching natural movie scenes. We found that the simulated network produced stimulus-related LFP changes that were in striking agreement with the LFPs obtained from the primary visual cortex. Moreover, our results demonstrate that the network encoded static input spike rates into gamma-range oscillations generated by inhibitory-excitatory neural interactions and encoded slow dynamic features of the input into slow LFP fluctuations mediated by stimulus-neural interactions. The model cortical network processed dynamic stimuli with naturalistic temporal structure by using low and high response frequencies as independent communication channels, again in agreement with recent reports from visual cortex responses to naturalistic movies. One potential function of this frequency decomposition into independent information channels operated by the cortical network may be that of enhancing the capacity of the cortical column to encode our complex sensory environment.},

	Abstract = {We propose a computational model for the task-specific guidance of visual attention in real-world scenes. Our model emphasizes four aspects that are important in biological vision: determining task-relevance of an entity, biasing attention for the low-level visual features of desired targets, recognizing these targets using the same low-level features, and incrementally building a visual map of task-relevance at every scene location. Given a task definition in the form of keywords, the model first determines and stores the task-relevant entities in working memory, using prior knowledge stored in long-term memory. It attempts to detect the most relevant entity by biasing its visual attention system with the entity's learned low-level features. It attends to the most salient location in the scene, and attempts to recognize the attended object through hierarchical matching against object representations stored in long-term memory. It updates its working memory with the task-relevance of the recognized entity and updates a topographic task-relevance map with the location and relevance of the recognized entity. The model is tested on three types of tasks: single-target detection in 343 natural and synthetic images, where biasing for the target accelerates target detection over twofold on average; sequential multiple-target detection in 28 natural images, where biasing, recognition, working memory and long term memory contribute to rapidly finding all targets; and learning a map of likely locations of cars from a video clip filmed while driving on a highway. The model's performance on search for single features and feature conjunctions is consistent with existing psychophysical data. These results of our biologically-motivated architecture suggest that the model may provide a reasonable approximation to many brain processes involved in complex task-driven visual behaviors.},

	Abstract = {Psychophysical evidence in humans indicates that localization is different for stationary flashed and coherently moving objects. To address how the primary visual cortex represents object position we used a population approach that pools spiking activity of many neurones in cat area 17. In response to flashed stationary squares (0.4 deg) we obtained localized activity distributions in visual field coordinates, which we referred to as profiles across a 'population receptive field' (PRF). We here show how motion trajectories can be derived from activity across the PRF and how the representation of moving and flashed stimuli differs in position. We found that motion was represented by peaks of population activity that followed the stimulus with a speed-dependent lag. However, time-to-peak latencies were shorter by approximately 16 ms compared to the population responses to stationary flashes. In addition, motion representation showed a directional bias, as latencies were more reduced for peripheral-to-central motion compared to the opposite direction. We suggest that a moving stimulus provides 'preactivation' that allows more rapid processing than for a single flash event.},

@article{mcdonald2008a,
	Abstract = {Abstract People are slow to react to objects that appear at recently attended locations. This delay-known as inhibition of return (IOR)-is believed to aid search of the visual environment by discouraging inspection of recently inspected objects. However, after two decades of research, there is no evidence that IOR reflects an inhibition in the covert deployment of attention. Here, observers participated in a modified visual-search task that enabled us to measure IOR and an ERP component called the posterior contralateral N2 (N2pc) that reflects the covert deployment of attention. The N2pc was smaller when a target appeared at a recently attended location than when it appeared at a recently unattended location. This reduction was due to modulation of neural processing in the visual cortex and the right parietal lobe. Importantly, there was no evidence for a delay in the N2pc. We conclude that in our task, the inhibitory processes underlying IOR reduce the probability of shifting attention to recently attended locations but do not delay the covert deployment of attention itself.},

	Abstract = {Extraclassical receptive field phenomena in V1 are commonly attributed to long-range lateral connections and/or extrastriate feedback. We address 2 such phenomena: surround suppression and receptive field expansion at low contrast. We present rigorous computational support for the hypothesis that the phenomena largely result from local short-range (< 0.5 mm) cortical connections and lateral geniculate nucleus input. The neural mechanisms of surround suppression in our simulations operate via (A) enhancement of inhibition, (B) reduction of excitation, or (C) action of both simultaneously. Mechanisms (B) and (C) are substantially more prevalent than (A). We observe, on average, a growth in the spatial summation extent of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs for low-contrast stimuli. However, we find this is neither sufficient nor necessary to explain receptive field expansion at low contrast, which usually involves additional changes in the relative gain of these inputs.},

	Abstract = {From the pair of 2-D images formed on the retinas, the brain is capable of synthesizing a rich 3-D representation of our visual surroundings. The horizontal separation of the two eyes gives rise to small positional differences, called binocular disparities, between corresponding features in the two retinal images. These disparities provide a powerful source of information about 3-D scene structure, and alone are sufficient for depth perception. How do visual cortical areas of the brain extract and process these small retinal disparities, and how is this information transformed into non-retinal coordinates useful for guiding action? Although neurons selective for binocular disparity have been found in several visual areas, the brain circuits that give rise to stereoscopic vision are not very well understood. I review recent electrophysiological studies that address four issues: the encoding of disparity at the first stages of binocular processing, the organization of disparity-selective neurons into topographic maps, the contributions of specific visual areas to different stereoscopic tasks, and the integration of binocular disparity and viewing-distance information to yield egocentric distance. Some of these studies combine traditional electrophysiology with psychophysical and computational approaches, and this convergence promises substantial future gains in our understanding of stereoscopic vision.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the evidence for the cost-effectiveness of health behaviour interventions that address the major behavioural risk factors for chronic disease, including smoking, physical inactivity, poor diet, and alcohol misuse. METHODS: Medical and economic databases were searched for relevant economic evaluations. Studies were critically appraised using a published 35-point checklist, and the results are described using a narrative approach, noting methodological limitations. The review included 64 studies from 1995-2005, including 17 reports on multiple behaviour interventions. RESULTS: There was considerable variation among the studies by target populations, intervention components, primary outcomes, and economic methods, but the reported incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were consistently low (e.g. <14,000 Euros per quality-adjusted life-year gained for smoking-cessation programmes in 2006 Euros) as compared to certain preventive pharmaceutical and invasive interventions. Interventions targeting high-risk-population subgroups were relatively better value for money as compared to those targeting general populations. DISCUSSION: In general, the results of this review demonstrate favourable cost-effectiveness for smoking interventions, physical activity interventions and multiple behaviour interventions in high-risk groups. Although alcohol and dietary interventions appeared to be economically favourable, it is difficult to draw conclusions because of the variety in study outcomes. However, methodological limitations weaken the generalizability of findings, and suggest that the results of any given study should be considered carefully when being used to inform resource allocation.},

	Abstract = {During normal saccadic inspection of natural images, the receptive fields of cortical neurons are bombarded with frequent simultaneous changes in local mean luminance and contrast, yet there have been no systematic studies of how cortical neurons respond to such stimulation. The responses of single neurons in the primary visual cortex of the cat were measured for 200 ms presentations of sine-wave gratings confined to the conventional receptive field. Both local mean luminance and contrast were parametrically and randomly varied over the 1-1.5 log unit ranges that are typical of natural images. We find that responses are strongly modulated by both the local mean luminance and contrast, but in an approximately separable manner: the contrast response function is approximately invariant except for a scale factor that depends on the local mean luminance. The shape of the temporal response profiles were found to be approximately invariant with contrast, but were strongly affected by the local mean luminance. The results suggest that most, if not all, cortical neurons carry substantial local luminance information.},

	Annote = {they show that the effect of mean luminance and luminance contrast is separable on neurons stimulated with their optimal stimuli. The effect of changing the mean luminance of the stimulus is same regardless of the current contrast level. Changing the mean luminance does not have differential effects depending on the luminance contrast of the stimulus. Authors argue that this could be an adaptive phenomena to the statistics of natural images as it seems that mean luminance and contrast are indepedent on the natural images. An assumption directly related to our research. We should test this. Ultimately they show that nervous system's representation of visual scenes contains information regarding the mean luminance. They also say how the codin should be if these features were dependent. But I dont understand. Important link to frazor and geisler paper, must read. I wonder also why retina do not take the effect of mean luminance changes away? Didnt we always learn that retina cancels these changes away?},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the significance of treatment with antithyroid drugs longer than 12 months on lasting remission in Graves' hyperthyroid patients, and to study clinical and laboratory parameters of prognostic value. PATIENTS: Fifty-two untreated Graves' hyperthyroid patients were assigned at random to two therapeutic groups. They were treated with carbimazole during 12 and 24 months in Group I (n = 28) and Group II (n = 24), respectively. MEASUREMENTS: Serum levels of FT4, T3, sTSH and TSH receptor antibody (TRAb) were measured before starting treatment and at regular intervals during treatment and follow-up after drug withdrawal. We compared the relapse rate in both groups of patients, at short (2-yr) and long-term (5-yr) periods after drug withdrawal. Also, we compared clinical and biochemical parameters between patients who stayed in remission and who had relapse. RESULTS: At the end of the short-term period, relapse had occurred in 13 (46.4%) Group I patients and in 13 (54.1%) Group II patients, p = 0.36. At the end of the long-term period, relapse had occurred in 24 (85.7%) Group I and 20 (83.3%) Group II patients, p = 0.78. No difference could be observed between patients who had stayed in remission and who had suffered relapse, within the 5-yr follow-up period regarding to goiter size, frequency of ophthalmopathy, TSH and TRAb levels. CONCLUSIONS: The high relapse rate observed could be due to high iodine intake in our country. In this study and in a review of the available data, we have been unable to find any rational basis for courses of antithyroid drugs longer than twelve months for the treatment of Graves' hyperthyroidism.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

	Abstract = {Antithyroid drugs are commonly used as first-line treatment for Graves' disease, but the optimum regimen for inducing remission remains unclear. We gave the block-replace regimen of carbimazole plus thyroxine to 100 patients for 6 or 12 months, to determine whether prolonged treatment is associated with fewer relapses. The remission rate one year after cessation of treatment was 59% with the 6 month course and 65% with 12 months; this was not significantly different. We also analysed HLA markers identified by restriction fragment length polymorphisms and could not confirm the recently reported associations of outcome with HLA-DR4 or with an HLA-DQA2 allele. These results show that six months treatment with a block-replace regimen of antithyroid drugs is probably sufficient, in the UK, to achieve maximum remission of Graves' disease and that there are no HLA markers which clearly predict outcome.},

@article{harper2004a,
	Abstract = {A sound, depending on the position of its source, can take more time to reach one ear than the other. This interaural (between the ears) time difference (ITD) provides a major cue for determining the source location. Many auditory neurons are sensitive to ITDs, but the means by which such neurons represent ITD is a contentious issue. Recent studies question whether the classical general model (the Jeffress model) applies across species. Here we show that ITD coding strategies of different species can be explained by a unifying principle: that the ITDs an animal naturally encounters should be coded with maximal accuracy. Using statistical techniques and a stochastic neural model, we demonstrate that the optimal coding strategy for ITD depends critically on head size and sound frequency. For small head sizes and/or low-frequency sounds, the optimal coding strategy tends towards two distinct sub-populations tuned to ITDs outside the range created by the head. This is consistent with recent observations in small mammals. For large head sizes and/or high frequencies, the optimal strategy is a homogeneous distribution of ITD tunings within the range created by the head. This is consistent with observations in the barn owl. For humans, the optimal strategy to code ITDs from an acoustically measured distribution depends on frequency; above 400 Hz a homogeneous distribution is optimal, and below 400 Hz distinct sub-populations are optimal.},

	Abstract = {Autoantibodies against complement C1q (anti-C1q) have been well described in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, where they correlate with the occurrence of severe lupus nephritis. However, data on anti-C1q in organ-specific autoimmune diseases are scarce. In order to determine the prevalence of anti-C1q in patients with autoimmune thyroid disorders (AITD) and a possible association with thyroid function, we measured prospectively anti-C1q in 23 patients with Graves' disease (GD) and 52 patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT). Anti-C1q levels were correlated with parameters of thyroid function and autoantibodies against thyroperoxidase, thyroglobulin and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor. Twenty-one patients with multi-nodular goitre and 72 normal blood donors served as controls. We found elevated concentrations of anti-C1q more frequently in patients with AITD than in controls: seven of 23 (30%) patients with GD and 11 of 52 (21%) patients with HT, compared with one of 21 (5%) patients with multi-nodular goitre and six of 72 (8%) normal controls. Anti-C1q levels did not correlate with thyroid autoantibodies. However, in GD absolute levels of anti-C1q correlated negatively with TSH and positively with free thyroxine (FT4) and triiodothyronine (FT3). In contrast, in HT, anti-C1q correlated positively with TSH levels. No correlation between TSH and thyroid autoantibodies was found. In conclusion, we found an increased prevalence of anti-C1q in patients with AITD and their levels correlated with the thyroid function in both GD and HT. This correlation seems to be independent of thyroid autoantibodies. Therefore, anti-C1q might point to a pathogenic mechanism involved in the development of AITD that is independent of classical thyroid autoantibodies.},

	Abstract = {Recruitment of movement-related muscle synergies involves the functional linking of motor cortical points. We asked how the outputs of two simultaneously stimulated motor cortical points would interact. To this end, experiments were done in ketamine-anesthetized cats. When prolonged (e.g., 500 ms) trains of intracortical microstimulation were applied in the primary motor cortex, stimulus currents as low as 10-20 microA evoked coordinated movements of the contralateral forelimb. Paw kinematics in three dimensions and the electromyographic (EMG) activity of eight muscles were simultaneously recorded. We show that the EMG outputs of two cortical points simultaneously stimulated are additive. The movements were represented as displacement vectors pointing from initial to final paw position. The displacement vectors resulting from simultaneous stimulation of two cortical points pointed in nearly the same direction as the algebraic resultant vector. Linear summation of outputs was also found when inhibition at one of the cortical points was reduced by GABAA receptor antagonists. A simple principle emerges from these results. Notwithstanding the underlying complex neuronal circuitry, motor cortex outputs combine nearly linearly in terms of movement direction and muscle activation patterns. Importantly, simultaneous activation does not change the nature of the output at each point. An additional implication is that not all possible movements need be explicitly represented in the motor cortex; a large number of different movements may be synthesized from a smaller repertoire.},

	Abstract = {Results from physiological, theoretical, and computational studies {suggest} that the visual cortex processes natural sensory information with a strategy of sparse coding. To investigate whether this is also the case for retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), neuronal activities were recorded from a group of chicken RGCs in response to natural, time-varying images (movies) using extracellular multi-electrode recording system. The response of single RGC in exposure to natural stimulation showed sparse activity, while the ensemble responses did not. Such result may suggest that at the RGC level, the single unit activity is kept at a low level in response to natural stimuli for energy-saving, but the neuronal population are often activated in a correlated manner to achieve efficient information transmission.},

@article{weliky1994a,
	Abstract = {In cat striate cortex, patchy horizontal axonal projections link columns of similar orientation specificity. To assess the physiological correlates of such clustered projections, a new multisite stimulation technique was used to functionally map the pattern of horizontal synaptic inputs onto single layer 2/3 cells within tangential slices of developing ferret visual cortex. Twenty-four separate sets of horizontal fibers were stimulated within a 1200 microns strip of cortex, while evoked synaptic responses were recorded using whole-cell patch methods. For most cells, input maps demonstrated the presence of clustered horizontal connections in which multiple strong and weak synaptic responses were alternately evoked across the stimulated cortical region. Recordings from up to nine cells in a single slice revealed that patterns of synaptic input were closely correlated for cells in close proximity, and that this correlation decreased with distance, with no correlation at distances greater than 500 microns. To determine whether these physiological results were consistent with the known anatomical linkage of iso-orientation columns by clustered horizontal connections, mathematical analysis and computer simulations were performed upon orientation tuning maps obtained from optical imaging of activity-dependent intrinsic signals in mature ferret visual cortex. Optical imaging revealed an organization of iso-orientation domains consisting of broad regions of cortex across which orientation preference smoothly varied, together with "orientation centers" around which orientation preference was arranged in a pinwheel manner. The distribution of synaptic connections between different cortical sites was simulated by a model of functionally linked iso- orientation columns. Simulated synaptic input maps, generated by the same stimulation and recording arrangements used in our experimental protocol, accurately reproduced the observed patterns of clustered inputs onto experimentally recorded cells. These results indicate that even at the time of eye opening, prior to extensive visual experience, most cells receive patterns of synaptic inputs consistent with a clustered organization of horizontal connections that functionally link iso-orientation columns.},

@article{metso2004a,
	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the cumulative incidence of hypothyroidism during long-term follow-up in patients treated for hyperthyroidism by radioactive iodine (131)I (RAI) therapy, the significance of clinical factors in predicting the development of hypothyroidism, and the outcome after a fixed 7 mCi (259 MBq) dose of RAI. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study of patients treated for hyperthyroidism by RAI. PATIENTS AND MEASUREMENTS: Since 1965, details on 2043 patients treated by RAI therapy in Tampere University Hospital were entered into a computerized register. Following RAI treatment, thyroid status was monitored every 1-3 months during the first year, and subsequently at 1-3-year intervals until June 2002 or until the patient died or moved out of the Tampere University Hospital district. results The cumulative incidence of hypothyroidism in patients with Graves' disease and toxic multinodular goitre at 1, 10 and 25 years was 24%vs. 4%, 59%vs. 15% and 82%vs. 32%, respectively. In a Cox regression model, previous partial thyroidectomy [risk ratio (RR) = 1.63 in patients with Graves' disease and RR = 1.59 in those with toxic multinodular goitre] and age at the first RAI treatment (RR = 0.998 and RR = 0.996 per year) were statistically significantly associated with the development of hypothyroidism both in patients with Graves' disease and in those with toxic multinodular goitre. Antithyroid medication preceding RAI therapy (RR = 0.47) decreased and female gender (RR = 1.53) increased the risk of hypothyroidism only in patients with Graves' disease. Administration of a single dose of RAI resulted in the control of hyperthyroidism in 75% of patients, while two to six RAI treatments were needed in 25% of patients to achieve either a hypothyroid or a euthyroid state in both groups. None of the clinical factors studied was associated with the remission rate either in patients with Graves' disease or in those with toxic multinodular goitre. The remission rate did not differ between the patients who received a dose of RAI calculated according to the uptake of RAI and thyroid size and those who received an empirical dose of RAI. The fixed 7 mCi (259 MBq) dose of RAI cured 80% of patients. CONCLUSION: RAI treatment is effective in treating hyperthyroidism in patients with Graves' disease, but hypothyroidism will develop in 82% of patients in 25 years. Because the development of hypothyroidism seems to be inevitable and unpredictable by any clinical factors, the objective of RAI treatment should be to minimize the persistence of hyperthyroidism with the simplest possible form of treatment. We recommend a fixed 7 mCi dose of RAI to be used as the first empirical dose in the treatment of hyperthyroidism, at least in Graves' disease.},

	Abstract = {Emotion plays a critical role in many contemporary accounts of decision making, but exactly what underlies its influence and how this is mediated in the brain remain far from clear. Here, we review behavioral studies that suggest that Pavlovian processes can exert an important influence over choice and may account for many effects that have traditionally been attributed to emotion. We illustrate how recent experiments cast light on the underlying structure of Pavlovian control and argue that generally this influence makes good computational sense. Corresponding neuroscientific data from both animals and humans implicate a central role for the amygdala through interactions with other brain areas. This yields a neurobiological account of emotion in which it may operate, often covertly, to optimize rather than corrupt economic choice.},

	Abstract = {A patient with bilateral damage to primary visual (striated) cortex has provided the opportunity to assess just what visual capacities are possible in the absence of geniculo-striate pathways. Patient TN suffered two strokes in succession, lesioning each visual cortex in turn and causing clinical blindness over his whole visual field. Functional and anatomical brain imaging assessments showed that TN completely lacks any functional visual cortex. We report here that, among other retained abilities, he can successfully navigate down the extent of a long corridor in which various barriers were placed. A video recording shows him skillfully avoiding and turning around the blockages. This demonstrates that extra-striate pathways in humans can sustain sophisticated visuo-spatial skills in the absence of perceptual awareness, akin to what has been previously reported in monkeys. It remains to be determined which of the several extra-striate pathways account for TN's intact navigation skills.},

	Abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Most visual environments contain more information than the human brain can process in real time. To overcome this limitation, the attention system acts as a filter by selectively orienting attention to specific regions of the visual field. This ability to orient attention can be reflected in covert shift processes of attention. LITERATURE FINDINGS: In a typical covert orienting task, subjects have to maintain fixation on a central cross and respond as quickly as possible to a target, which appears in a peripheral box following a cue that summons attention to the direction where the target is going to appear (valid cueing) or to the contralateral direction (invalid cueing). When the cues are nonpredictive, the response characteristics critically depend on stimulus-onset asynchrony (SOA). With short SOAs (<300ms), valid cues result in a reaction time advantage over invalid trials, which is due to a reflexive shift of attention towards the source of stimulation. In contrast, with longer SOAs, valid cues result in longer reaction times to the subsequent target. DISCUSSION: This phenomenon is known as the inhibition of return and is mostly thought to reflect an inhibitory mechanism protecting the organism from redirecting attention to previously scanned insignificant locations. Many studies have reported blunted or delayed inhibition of return in patients with schizophrenia. However, some authors reported normal amounts of inhibition of return. This can be partly explained by the use of manipulations of the covert orienting of the attention paradigm that is known to enhance the course of inhibition of return. CONCLUSION: The deficit of inhibition of return seems to be time-stable and to be unrelated to psychopathology or length of illness. The contribution of neuroleptic medication to this deficit cannot be determined. Recent data suggest a deficit of inhibition of return in two human models of psychosis (dimethyltryptamine and ketamine). Further studies should clarify whether blunted inhibition of return might represent a trait marker of schizophrenia.},

	Abstract = {We present a generalized reverse correlation technique that can be used to estimate the spatio-temporal receptive fields (STRFs) of sensory neurons from their responses to arbitrary stimuli such as auditory vocalizations or natural visual scenes. The general solution for STRF estimation requires normalization of the stimulus-response cross-correlation by the stimulus autocorrelation matrix. When the second-order stimulus statistics are stationary, normalization involves only the diagonal elements of the Fourier-transformed auto-correlation matrix (the power spectrum). In the non-stationary case normalization requires the entire auto-correlation matrix. We present modelling studies that demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of this method as well as neurophysiological data comparing STRFs estimated using natural versus synthetic stimulus ensembles. For both auditory and visual neurons, STRFs obtained with these different stimuli are similar, but exhibit systematic differences that may be functionally significant. This method should be useful for determining what aspects of natural signals are represented by sensory neurons and may reveal novel response properties of these neurons.},

	Abstract = {The study of human learning is complicated by the myriad of processing elements involved in conducting any behavioral task. In the case of visual perceptual learning, there has been significant controversy regarding the task processes that guide the formation of this learning. However, there is a developing consensus that top-down, task-related factors are required for such learning to take place. Here we challenge this idea by use of a novel procedure in which human participants, who were deprived of food and water, passively viewed visual stimuli while receiving occasional drops of water as rewards. Visual orientation stimuli, which were temporally paired with the liquid rewards, were viewed monocularly and rendered imperceptible by continuously flashing contour-rich patterns to the other eye. Results show that visual learning can be formed in human adults through stimulus-reward pairing in the absence of a task and without awareness of the stimulus presentation or reward contingencies.},

@article{rucci2008a,
	Abstract = {Perception and motor control are often regarded as two separate branches of neuroscience. Like most species, however, humans are not passively exposed to the incoming flow of sensory data, but actively seek useful information. By shaping input signals in ways that simplify perceptual tasks, behavior might play an important role in establishing efficient sensory representations in the brain. Under natural viewing conditions, the main source of motion of the stimulus on the retina is not the scene but our own behavior. The retinal image is never still, even during visual fixation, when small eye movements combine with movements of the head and body to continually perturb the location of gaze. This article examines the impact of the fixational motion of the retinal image on the statistics of visual input and the neural encoding of visual information. Building upon recent theoretical and experimental results, it is argued that an unstable fixation constitutes an efficient strategy for acquiring information from natural scenes. According to this theory, the fluctuations of luminance caused by the incessant motion of the eye equalize the power present at different spatial frequencies in the spatiotemporal stimulus on the retina. This phenomenon yields compact neural representations, emphasizes fine spatial detail, and might enable a temporal multiplexing of visual information from the retina to the cortex. This theory posits motor contributions to early visual representations and suggests that perception and behavior are more intimately tied than commonly thought.},

	Abstract = {Perception of a visual attribute, such as orientation, is strongly dependent on the context within which a feature is presented, such as that seen in the tilt illusion. The possibility that the neurophysiological basis for this phenomenon may be manifest at the level of cells in striate cortex is suggested by anatomical and physiological observations of orientation dependent long range horizontal connections which relate disparate points in the visual field. This study explores the dependency of the functional properties of single cells on visual context. We observed several influences of the visual field area surrounding cells' receptive field on the properties of the receptive field center: inhibition or facilitation dependent on the orientation of the surround, shifts in orientation preference and changes in the bandwidth of orientation tuning. To relate these changes to perceptual changes in orientation we modeled a neuronal ensemble encoding orientation. Our results show that the filter characteristics of striate cortical cells are not necessarily fixed, but can be dynamic, changing according to context.},

	Abstract = {A fundamental question in perception is how we visually encode and retain information about a complex scene in order to allow effective operation within it. Interestingly, the stimuli used to investigate scene perception have varied greatly between studies, ranging from line drawings to coloured drawings, computer-generated scenes, photographs, and real scenes. Are findings from these different types of scene stimulus equally ecologically valid? Two experiments are reported that address this issue. In the first we compared photographic and non-photographic scenes and found that observers perform better in questions testing object memory when viewing photographs, suggesting an initial benefit for encoding information from photographs. In the second we found that whether or not non-photographic scenes obeyed realistic scene-organising properties influenced object-memory formation. Effects varied for the different question types, but again were most prominent early in viewing. We conclude that in the search for an understanding of everyday scene perception we must be very careful in our choice of scene stimuli and in our interpretation of findings from the laboratory.},

Because signals in our sensory and motor systems are corrupted by variability or noise, the nervous system needs to estimate these states. To select an optimal action these state estimates need to be combined with knowledge of the potential costs or rewards of different action outcomes. We review recent studies that have investigated the mechanisms used by the nervous system to solve such estimation and decision problems, which show that human behaviour is close to that predicted by Bayesian Decision Theory. This theory defines optimal behaviour in a world characterized by uncertainty, and provides a coherent way of describing sensorimotor processes.},

	Abstract = {The mouse vomeronasal organ (VNO) is thought to mediate social behaviors and neuroendocrine changes elicited by pheromonal cues. The molecular mechanisms underlying the sensory response to pheromones and the behavioral repertoire induced through the VNO are not fully characterized. Using the tools of mouse genetics and multielectrode recording, we demonstrate that the sensory activation of VNO neurons requires TRP2, a putative ion channel of the transient receptor potential family that is expressed exclusively in these neurons. Moreover, we show that male mice deficient in TRP2 expression fail to display male-male aggression, and they initiate sexual and courtship behaviors toward both males and females. Our study suggests that, in the mouse, sensory activation of the VNO is essential for sex discrimination of conspecifics and thus ensures gender-specific behavior.},

	Abstract = {A prominent and stereotypical feature of cortical circuitry in the striate cortex is a plexus of long-range horizontal connections, running for 6-8 mm parallel to the cortical surface, which has a clustered distribution. This is seen for both intrinsic cortical connections within a particular cortical area and the convergent and divergent connections running between area 17 and other cortical areas. To determine if these connections are related to the columnar functional architecture of cortex, we combined labeling of the horizontal connections by retrograde transport of rhodamine-filled latex microspheres (beads) and labeling of the orientation columns by 2-deoxyglucose autoradiography. We first mapped the distribution of orientation columns in a small region of area 17 or 18, then made a small injection of beads into the center of an orientation column of defined specificity, and after allowing for retrograde transport, labeled vertical orientation columns with the 2-deoxyglucose technique. The retrogradely labeled cells were confined to regions of orientation specificity similar to that of the injection site, indicating that the horizontal connections run between columns of similar orientation specificity. This relationship was demonstrated for both the intrinsic horizontal and corticocortical connections. The extent of the horizontal connections, which allows single cells to integrate information over larger parts of the visual field than that covered by their receptive fields, and the functional specificity of the connections, suggests possible roles for these connections in visual processing.},

	Abstract = {In a natural setting, the mean luminance and contrast of the light within a visual neuron's receptive field are constantly changing as the eyes saccade across complex scenes. Adaptive mechanisms modulate filtering properties of the early visual pathway in response to these variations, allowing the system to maintain differential sensitivity to nonstationary stimuli. An adaptive variant of the reverse correlation technique is used to characterize these changes during single trials. Properties of the adaptive reverse correlation algorithm were investigated via simulation. Analysis of data collected from the mammalian visual system demonstrates the ability to continuously track adaptive changes in the encoding scheme. The adaptive estimation approach provides a framework for characterizing the role of adaptation in natural scene viewing.},

	Abstract = {We cast the problem of corner detection as a corner search process. We develop principles of foveated visual search and automated fixation selection to accomplish the corner search, supplying a case study of both foveated search and foveated feature detection. The result is a new algorithm for finding corners, which is also a corner-based algorithm for aiming computed foveated visual fixations. In the algorithm, long saccades move the fovea to previously unexplored areas of the image, while short saccades improve the accuracy of putative corner locations. The system is tested on two natural scenes. As an interesting comparison study, we compare fixations generated by the algorithm with those of subjects viewing the same images, whose eye movements are being recorded by an eye tracker. The comparison of fixation patterns is made using an information-theoretic measure. Results show that the algorithm is a good locater of corners, but does not correlate particularly well with human visual fixations.},

	Abstract = {Recordings from monkey primary visual cortex (V1) were used to test a model for the visually driven responses of simple cells. According to the model, simple cells compute a linear sum of the responses of lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) neurons. In addition, each simple cell's linear response is divided by the pooled activity of a large number of other simple cells. The cell membrane performs both operations; synaptic currents are summed and then divided by the total membrane conductance. Current and conductance are decoupled (by a complementary arrangement of excitation and inhibition) so that current depends only on the LGN inputs and conductance depends only on the cortical inputs. Closed form expressions were derived for fitting and interpreting physiological data. The model accurately predicted responses to drifting grating stimuli of various contrasts, orientations, and spatiotemporal frequencies.},

	Abstract = {Some 30 years ago, Trevarthen {\$}[{\$}1{\$}]{\$} introduced the idea of two separate visual systems, a focal system for fine motor acts and an ambient system for gross body movements such as ambulation. More recent developments indicating anatomically and physiologically separate pathways in primate vision [2] have led to a different idea of separate visual systems, one for conscious perception and one for action [3]. It has received empirical support from several studies showing that pointing, reaching, and grasping can remain accurate while the perceived position or size of objects is subject to illusory distortion [4-6]. However, much of this evidence has been challenged on the grounds of methodological flaws, particularly failure to match perfectly the conditions for verbal and motor tasks and failure to replicate results [7-10]. Here we take advantage of the strong compression of perceived position that occurs around the time of saccadic eye movements [11, 12]. Under normal lighting conditions, stimuli flashed briefly over a wide range of spatial positions just before saccadic onset are neither seen nor reached for in their veridical positions, but are compressed toward the saccadic target. We validate the idea of separate systems by showing that, in the dark, subjects are able to point accurately to the correct target position, even though their verbal reports are still subject to compression.},

	Abstract = {Whereas gamma-band neuronal oscillations clearly appear integral to visual attention, the role of lower-frequency oscillations is still being debated. Mounting evidence indicates that a key functional property of these oscillations is the rhythmic shifting of excitability in local neuronal ensembles. Here, we show that when attended stimuli are in a rhythmic stream, delta-band oscillations in the primary visual cortex entrain to the rhythm of the stream, resulting in increased response gain for task-relevant events and decreased reaction times. Because of hierarchical cross-frequency coupling, delta phase also determines momentary power in higher-frequency activity. These instrumental functions of low-frequency oscillations support a conceptual framework that integrates numerous earlier findings.},

	Abstract = {The Modern Synthesis (MS) is the current paradigm in evolutionary biology. It was actually built by expanding on the conceptual foundations laid out by its predecessors, Darwinism and neo-Darwinism. For sometime now there has been talk of a new Extended Evolutionary Synthesis (EES), and this article begins to outline why we may need such an extension, and how it may come about. As philosopher Karl Popper has noticed, the current evolutionary theory is a theory of genes, and we still lack a theory of forms. The field began, in fact, as a theory of forms in Darwin's days, and the major goal that an EES will aim for is a unification of our theories of genes and of forms. This may be achieved through an organic grafting of novel concepts onto the foundational structure of the MS, particularly evolvability, phenotypic plasticity, epigenetic inheritance, complexity theory, and the theory of evolution in highly dimensional adaptive landscapes.},

	Abstract = {The functional and structural topography of lateral inhibitory connections was investigated in visual cortical area 18 using a combination of optical imaging and anatomical tracing techniques in the same tissue. Orientation maps were obtained by recording intrinsic signals in regions of 8.4-19 mm2. To reveal the inhibitory connections provided by large basket cells, biocytin was iontophoretically injected at identified orientation sites guided by the pattern of surface blood vessels. The axonal and dendritic fields of two retrogradely labelled large basket cells were reconstructed in layer III. Their axonal fields extended up to 1360 microns from the parent somata. In addition to single basket cells, the population of labelled basket cell axons was also studied. For this analysis anterogradely labelled basket axons running horizontally over 460-1280 microns from the core of an injection site in layer III were taken into account. The distribution of large basket cell terminals according to orientation preferences of their target regions was quantitatively assessed. Using the same spatial resolution as the orientation map, a frequency distribution of basket cell terminals dependent on orientation specificity could be derived. For individual basket cells, the results showed that, on average, 43% of the terminals provided input to sites showing similar orientation preferences (+/- 30 degrees) to those of the parent somata. About 35% of the terminals were directed to sites representing oblique-orientation [+/- (30-60) degrees], and 22% of them terminated at cross-orientation sites [+/- (60-90) degrees]. Furthermore, the possible impact of large basket cells on target cells at different distances and orientation preferences was estimated by comparing the occurrence of orientation preferences with the occurrence of basket terminals on the distance scale. It was found that a basket cell could elicit iso-orientation inhibition with a high impact between 100-400 and 800-1200 microns, strong cross-orientation inhibition at approximately 400-800 microns, and oblique-orientation inhibition between 300-500 and 700-900 microns from the parent soma. The non-isotropic topography of large basket axons suggests a complex function for this cell class, possibly including inhibition related to orientation and direction selectivity depending on the location of the target cells and possible target selectivity.},

	Abstract = {Understanding the conditions under which the brain integrates the different sensory streams and the mechanisms supporting this phenomenon is now a question at the forefront of neuroscience. In this paper, we discuss the opportunities for investigating these multisensory processes using modern imaging techniques, the nature of the information obtainable from each method and their benefits and limitations. Despite considerable variability in terms of paradigm design and analysis, some consistent findings are beginning to emerge. The detection of brain activity in human neuroimaging studies that resembles multisensory integration responses at the cellular level in other species, suggests similar crossmodal binding mechanisms may be operational in the human brain. These mechanisms appear to be distributed across distinct neuronal networks that vary depending on the nature of the shared information between different sensory cues. For example, differing extents of correspondence in time, space or content seem to reliably bias the involvement of different integrative networks which code for these cues. A combination of data obtained from haemodynamic and electromagnetic methods, which offer high spatial or temporal resolution respectively, are providing converging evidence of multisensory interactions at both "early" and "late" stages of processing--suggesting a cascade of synergistic processes operating in parallel at different levels of the cortex.},

@article{carandini1997b,
	Abstract = {Simple cells in the primary visual cortex often appear to compute a weighted sum of the light intensity distribution of the visual stimuli that fall on their receptive fields. A linear model of these cells has the advantage of simplicity and captures a number of basic aspects of cell function. It, however, fails to account for important response nonlinearities, such as the decrease in response gain and latency observed at high contrasts and the effects of masking by stimuli that fail to elicit responses when presented alone. To account for these nonlinearities we have proposed a normalization model, which extends the linear model to include mutual shunting inhibition among a large number of cortical cells. Shunting inhibition is divisive, and its effect in the model is to normalize the linear responses by a measure of stimulus energy. To test this model we performed extracellular recordings of simple cells in the primary visual cortex of anesthetized macaques. We presented large stimulus sets consisting of (1) drifting gratings of various orientations and spatiotemporal frequencies; (2) plaids composed of two drifting gratings; and (3) gratings masked by full-screen spatiotemporal white noise. We derived expressions for the model predictions and fitted them to the physiological data. Our results support the normalization model, which accounts for both the linear and the nonlinear properties of the cells. An alternative model, in which the linear responses are subject to a compressive nonlinearity, did not perform nearly as well.},

We propose that these connections are responsible for the spatial-phase invariance of complex-cell responses. In a network model with selective cortical amplification, neurons exhibit simple-cell responses when recurrent connections are weak and complex-cell responses when they are strong, suggesting that simple and complex cells are the low- and high-gain limits of the same basic cortical circuit. Given the ubiquity of invariant responses in cognitive processing, the recurrent mechanism we propose for complex cells may be widely applicable.},

	Abstract = {We provide an overall view of the functional tonotopic organization of the auditory cortex in the rat. We apply a recently developed technique for acquiring intrinsic signal optical maps, Fourier imaging, in the rat auditory cortex. These highly detailed maps, derived in a several-minute-long recording procedure, delineate multiple auditory cortical areas and demonstrate their shapes, sizes, and tonotopic order. Beyond the primary auditory cortex, there are at least three distinct areas with fine-scale tonotopic organization, as well as at least one additional high-frequency field. The arrangement of all of these cortical areas is consistent across subjects. The accuracy of these optical maps was confirmed by microelectrode mapping in the same subjects. This imaging method allows fast mapping of the auditory cortex at high spatial resolution comparable to that provided by conventional microelectrode technique. Although spiking activity is largely responsible for the evoked intrinsic signals, certain features of the optical signal cannot be explained by spiking activity only, and should probably be attributed to other mechanisms inducing metabolic activity, such as subthreshold membrane phenomena.},

	Abstract = {Attention increases the contrast gain of V4 neurons, causing them to respond to an attended stimulus as though its contrast had increased. When multiple stimuli appear within a neuron's receptive field (RF), the neuron responds primarily to the attended stimulus. This suggests that cortical cells may be "hard wired" to respond preferentially to the highest-contrast stimulus in their RF, and neural systems for attention capitalize on this mechanism by dynamically increasing the effective contrast of the stimulus that is task relevant. To test this, we varied the relative contrast of two stimuli within the recorded neurons' RFs, while the monkeys attended away to another location. Increasing the physical contrast of one stimulus caused V4 neurons to respond preferentially to that stimulus and reduced their responses to competing stimuli. When attention was directed to the lower-contrast stimulus, it partially overcame the influence of a competing, higher-contrast stimulus.},

	Abstract = {The development of both long-range intracortical and interhemispheric connections depends on visual experience. Previous experiments showed that in strabismic but not in normal cats, clustered horizontal axon projections preferentially connect cell groups activated by the same eye. This indicates that there is selective stabilization of fibers between neurons exhibiting correlated activity. Extending these experiments, we investigated in strabismic cats: (1) whether tangential connections remain confined to columns of similar orientation preference within the subsystems of left and right eye domains; and (2) whether callosal connections also extend predominantly between neurons activated by the same eye and preferring similar orientations. To this end, we analyzed in strabismic cats the topographic relationships between orientation preference domains and both intrinsic and callosal connections of area 17. Red and green latex microspheres were injected into monocular iso-orientation domains identified by optical imaging of intrinsic signals. Additionally, domains sharing the ocular dominance and orientation preference of the neurons at the injection sites were visualized by 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) autoradiography. Quantitative analysis revealed that 56% of the retrogradely labeled cells within the injected area 17 and 60% of the transcallosally labeled neurons were located in the 2-DG-labeled iso-orientation domains. This indicates: (1) that strabismus does not interfere with the tendency of long-range horizontal fibers to link predominantly neurons of similar orientation preference; and (2) that the selection mechanisms for the stabilization of callosal connections are similar to those that are responsible for the specification of the tangential intrinsic connections.},

Yet many unanswered questions remain, and the shape of a genuinely physically embodied, environmentally embedded science of the mind is still unclear. In this article I will raise a number of critical questions concerning the nature and scope of this approach, drawing a distinction between two kinds of appeal to embodiment: (1) 'Simple' cases, in which bodily and environmental properties merely constrain accounts that retain the focus on inner organization and processing; and (2) More radical appeals, in which attention to bodily and environmental features is meant to transform both the subject matter and the theoretical framework of cognitive science.},

	Abstract = {Neocortical neurons expressing the serotonin 5-HT3 receptor (5-HT3R) were characterized in rat acute slices by using patch-clamp recordings combined with single-cell RT-PCR and histochemical labeling. The 5-HT3A receptor subunit was expressed selectively in a subset of GABAergic interneurons coexpressing cholecystokinin (CCK) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). The 5-HT3B subunit was never detected, indicating that 5-HT3Rs expressed by neocortical interneurons did not contain this subunit. In 5-HT3A-expressing VIP/CCK interneurons, serotonin induced fast membrane potential depolarizations by activating an inward current that was blocked by the selective 5-HT3R antagonist tropisetron. Furthermore, we observed close appositions between serotonergic fibers and the dendrites and somata of 5-HT3R-expressing neurons, suggestive of possible synaptic contacts. Indeed, in interneurons exhibiting rapid excitation by serotonin, local electrical stimulations evoked fast EPSCs of large amplitude that were blocked by tropisetron. Finally, 5-HT3R-expressing neurons were also excited by a nicotinic agonist, indicating that serotonergic and cholinergic fast synaptic transmission could converge onto VIP/CCK interneurons. Our results establish a clear correlation between the presence of the 5-HT3A receptor subunit in neocortical VIP/CCK GABAergic interneurons, its functional expression, and its synaptic activation by serotonergic afferent fibers from the brainstem raphe nuclei.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Electrical potentials produced by blinks and eye movements present serious problems for electroencephalographic (EEG) and event-related potential (ERP) data interpretation and analysis, particularly for analysis of data from some clinical populations. Often, all epochs contaminated by large eye artifacts are rejected as unusable, though this may prove unacceptable when blinks and eye movements occur frequently. METHODS: Frontal channels are often used as reference signals to regress out eye artifacts, but inevitably portions of relevant EEG signals also appearing in EOG channels are thereby eliminated or mixed into other scalp channels. A generally applicable adaptive method for removing artifacts from EEG records based on blind source separation by independent component analysis (ICA) (Neural Computation 7 (1995) 1129; Neural Computation 10(8) (1998) 2103; Neural Computation 11(2) (1999) 606) overcomes these limitations. RESULTS: Results on EEG data collected from 28 normal controls and 22 clinical subjects performing a visual selective attention task show that ICA can be used to effectively detect, separate and remove ocular artifacts from even strongly contaminated EEG recordings. The results compare favorably to those obtained using rejection or regression methods. CONCLUSIONS: The ICA method can preserve ERP contributions from all of the recorded trials and all the recorded data channels, even when none of the single trials are artifact-free.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The optimal treatment for Graves' disease in children is controversial. Antithyroid medications are often used initially, but many children eventually require alternative therapies. We evaluated predictors of remission after 2 years of antithyroid medication use. METHODS: We prospectively studied children who had Graves' disease and were treated with antithyroid medications. We compared children who achieved remission after 2 years with those who had persistent disease to determine which variables were associated with remission; multiple logistic regression and binary recursive partitioning analyses were used to evaluate interactions among predictive variables. RESULTS: Of 51 children who completed the study, 15 (29%) achieved remission. Children who achieved remission had lower thyroid hormone concentrations at presentation than those with persistent disease (free thyroxine: 6.17 +/- 3.10 vs 9.86 +/- 7.54 ng/dL; total triiodothyronine: 431 +/- 175 vs 561 +/- 225 ng/dL). Children who achieved remission were also more likely to be euthyroid within 3 months of initiating propylthiouracil (82% vs 29%). Binary recursive partitioning analysis identified rapid achievement of euthyroid status after initiation of propylthiouracil, lower initial triiodothyronine, and older age as significant predictors of remission. CONCLUSIONS; Thyroid hormone concentrations at diagnosis, age, and initial response to propylthiouracil can be used to stratify patients according to the likelihood of remission after 2 years of antithyroid medication use. These data provide a useful guide for clinical decision-making regarding Graves' disease in children.},

During the past decade, with the advent of multi-electrode recording and improved theoretical models, these questions have begun to yield answers. However, a complete understanding of neuronal variability, and, in particular, how it affects population codes, is missing. This is because variability in the brain is typically correlated, and although the exact effects of these correlations are not known, it is known that they can be large. Here, we review studies that address the interaction between neuronal noise and population codes, and discuss their implications for population coding in general.},

	Abstract = {X-linked incomplete achromatopsia (XIA), also called blue-cone monochromacy (BCM), is a rare cone disorder that most commonly results either from one of two conditions. The first condition is a deletion of the locus control region (LCR) which is a critical DNA element that lies upstream of the L and M photopigment gene array on the X-chromosome and is necessary for expression of the photopigment genes. The second condition is an inactivating point mutation within the coding sequence of the remaining photopigment gene in an array from which all but one gene has been deleted. Many previous studies have concluded that affected individuals either have only rods and S-cones (Blackwell {\&} Blackwell, 1957, 1961; Daw {\&} Enoch, 1973; Hess et al., 1989) or have rods, S-cones, and another cone type that contains the rod pigment (Pokorny et al., 1970; Alpern et al., 1971). However, Smith et al. (1983) described individuals with XIA who had residual L-cone function. Here we report results for a subject with XIA who appears to have residual M-cone function. Genetic analysis revealed that he had apparently normal genes for M-cone photopigment thus leaving open the possibility that he has a contribution to vision based on expression of these genes at a very low level.},

@article{mizokami2006a,
	Abstract = {Most wavelengths change hue when mixed with white light. These changes, known as the Abney effect, have been extensively studied to characterize nonlinearities in the neural coding of color, but their potential function remains obscure. We measured the Abney effect in a new way--by varying the bandwidth of the spectrum rather than mixing with white--and this leads to a new interpretation of the role of nonlinear responses in color appearance. Because of the eye's limited spectral sensitivity, increasing the bandwidth of a spectrum changes the relative responses in the three classes of cone receptor and thus would change hue if the percept were tied to a fixed cone ratio. However, we found that hue is largely independent of bandwidth and thus constant for a constant peak wavelength for stimuli with Gaussian spectra. This suggests that color appearance is compensated for the eye's spectral filtering, and that this compensation embodies specific perceptual inferences about how natural spectra vary. When a wavelength is instead diluted with white light--which does not bias the cone ratios--then the same compensation predicts changes in hue because the "right" response is made to the "wrong" stimulus. This model generates constant hue loci that are qualitatively consistent with measures of the Abney effect and provides a novel functional account of such effects in color appearance, in which postreceptoral responses are adjusted so that constant hue percepts are tied to consistent physical properties of the environment rather than consistent physiological properties such as the cone ratios.},

	Abstract = {We sought to ascertain how high the success rates of radioiodine therapy are for Graves' disease patients with large diffuse goiters when aiming for a constant absorbed dose of 250 Gy. Thirty-six patients with a thyroid volume of 50-110 mL were evaluated for changes in thyroid function and appearance 3, 6, and 12 months after radioiodine therapy. Success was defined as definitive elimination of hyperthyroidism following therapy (hypothyroidism corrected with thyroxine on diagnosis); failure as persistent/recurrent hyperthyroidism after 12 months. Overall success rate was 50%. However, a subgroup of 20 patients without simultaneous carbimazole (carbimazole-off) showed a highly significantly larger success rate (85%) than the 16 patients with simultaneous carbimazole (carbimazole-on) at the time of radioiodine therapy (6.3%, p < 0.000005). Successful cases showed a significantly higher volume reduction after radioiodine than failures (75.5% vs. 35.4%, p < 0.00005). Stepwise logistic regression showed that therapy failure was related to administration of carbimazole during radioiodine therapy (p < 0.0250 and absorbed dose (p < 0.05), but not thyroid function (free triiodothyronine [FT3] and free thyroxine [FT4]), initial thyroid volume or thyrotropin-receptor antibody (TRAb) value. However, a significant correlation of therapy success to absorbed dose (r = 0.69, p < 0.005) could be shown only for carbimazole-off patients, but not for the others. Finally, multivariate factor analysis consistently showed that therapy success was correlated only to absorbed dose and antithyroid drugs, not to initial thyroid volume, TRAb value, or thyroid function. Thyroid volume per se is not responsible for the lower success rate in Graves' disease patients with large goiters because even a comparable group of 32 Graves' disease patients with small thyroid glands (< or =20 mL) and without simultaneous carbimazole showed a success rate of 87.5%. The high failure rate in the carbimazole-on patients (absorbed dose comparable to carbimazole-off) is due to the simultaneous administration of carbimazole. Therefore, if clinically feasible, we recommend discontinuing carbimazole at least one day before beginning radioiodine therapy.},

	Abstract = {Magnetoencephalographic and electroencephalographic evoked responses are primary real-time objective measures of cognitive and perceptual processes in the human brain. Two mechanisms (additive activity and phase reset) have been debated and considered as the only possible explanations for evoked responses. Here we present theoretical and empirical evidence of a third mechanism contributing to the generation of evoked responses. Interestingly, this mechanism can be deduced entirely from the characteristics of spontaneous oscillations in the absence of stimuli. We show that the amplitude fluctuations of neuronal alpha oscillations at rest are associated with changes in the mean value of ongoing activity in magnetoencephalography, a phenomenon that we term baseline shifts associated with alpha oscillations. When stimuli modulate the amplitude of alpha oscillations, baseline shifts become the basis of a novel mechanism for the generation of evoked responses; the averaging of several trials leads to a cancellation of the oscillatory component but the baseline shift remains, which gives rise to an evoked response. We propose that the presence of baseline shifts associated with alpha oscillations can be explained by the asymmetric flow of inward and outward neuronal currents related to the generation of alpha oscillations. Our findings are relevant to the vast majority of electroencephalographic and magnetoencephalographic studies involving perceptual, cognitive and motor activity.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To observe therapeutic effect of picking therapy on Graves' disease (GD) and its effects on thyroid function. METHODS: Sixty cases of GD were randomly divided into a treatment group (pricking therapy group) and a control group (medication group). They were treated respectively with pricking thyroid gland high point or oral administration of tapazole. And changes of total triiodothyronine (TT3), total thyroxine (TT4), free T3 (FT3), free T4 (FT4), thyroxine receptor antibody (TRAb), supersensitive thyrotropin (S-TSH) after treatment were investigated. RESULTS: The total effective rate was 93.33% in the treatment group and 76.67% in the control group with a significant difference between the two groups (P \textless 0.05). After treatment, serum TT3, TT4, FT3, FT4 and S-TSH contents had very significant change in the two groups (P \textless 0.01), TRAb had very significant change in the treatment group (P \textless 0.01) and no significant change in the control group (P \textgreater 0.05) there were significant differences in decrease of TT3, FT3, TRAb (P \textless 0.05) and no significant difference in decrease of TT4, FT4 and increase of S-TSH between the two groups (P \textgreater 0.05). CONCLUSION: Pricking therapy has a definite therapeutic effect on Graves' disease, which is carried out through regulating thyroid function.},

	Abstract = {The effect of temporal discontinuity on visual search was assessed by presenting a display in which one item had an abrupt onset, while other items were introduced by gradually removing line segments that camouflaged them. We hypothesized that an abrupt onset in a visual display would capture visual attention, giving this item a processing advantage over items lacking an abrupt leading edge. This prediction was confirmed in Experiment 1. We designed a second experiment to ensure that this finding was due to attentional factors rather than to sensory or perceptual ones. Experiment 3 replicated Experiment 1 and demonstrated that the procedure used to avoid abrupt onset--camouflage removal--did not require a gradual waveform. Implications of these findings for theories of attention are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Graves' disease, the most common cause of hyperthyroidism, is an autoimmune disorder. Antithyroid drugs have been selected as the first-line treatment of Graves' disease in Korea, Japan, and European countries. However, antithyroid drugs such as methimazole (MMI) and prophylthiouracil (PTU) have limitations in clinical applications because of their side effects. In this study, we performed a clinical trial and in vitro study to investigate the clinical effects and action mechanism of Ahnjeonbaekho-tang (AJBHT), an herbal remedy for Graves' disease. In a clinical study of Graves' disease patients who had side effects from antithyroid drugs, we found that treatment by AJBHT resulted in a reduction of serum triiodothyronine (T3) and free thyroxine (FT4) levels and an increase in thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels (T3: p\textless0.0001, FT4: p=0.0012, TSH: p=0.0370, respectively). In vitro, AJBHT significantly inhibits FRTL-5 cell proliferation, DNA synthesis, cyclic AMP production, T4 synthesis, and the expression of thyroglobulin (Tg) mRNA in comparison with the control. These results suggest that AJBHT might suppress T(4) synthesis by modulating adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) and Tg expression, and therefore, AJBHT could be an alternative therapy for Graves' disease patients who have side effects from antithyroid drugs.},

It is often assumed that such links involve only multimodal neural structures, but unimodal brain areas may also be affected. We tested the effect of simultaneous visuo-tactile stimulation on the activity of the human visual cortex. Tactile stimulation enhanced activity in the visual cortex, but only when it was on the same side as a visual target. Analysis of effective connectivity between brain areas suggests that touch influences unimodal visual cortex via back-projections from multimodal parietal areas. This provides a neural explanation for crossmodal links in spatial attention.},

How auditory neurons code sound level over such a range is unclear; firing rates of individual neurons increase with sound level over only a very limited portion of the full range of hearing. We show that neurons in the auditory midbrain of the guinea pig adjust their responses to the mean, variance and more complex statistics of sound level distributions. We demonstrate that these adjustments improve the accuracy of the neural population code close to the region of most commonly occurring sound levels. This extends the range of sound levels that can be accurately encoded, fine-tuning hearing to the local acoustic environment.},

	Abstract = {Although many studies have explored the neural correlates of visual attention and selection, few have examined the reliability with which neurons represent relevant information. We monitored activity in the frontal eye field (FEF) of monkeys trained to make a saccade to a target defined by the conjunction of color and shape or to a target defined by color differences. The difficulty of conjunction search was manipulated by varying the number of distractors, and the difficulty of feature search was manipulated by varying the similarity in color between target and distractors. The reliability of individual neurons in signaling the target location in correct trials was determined using a neuron-anti-neuron approach within a winner-take-all architecture. On average, approximately seven trials of the activity of single neurons were sufficient to match near-perfect behavioral performance in the easiest search, and approximately 14 trials were sufficient in the most difficult search. We also determined how many neurons recorded separately need to be evaluated within a trial to match behavioral performance. Results were quantitatively similar to those of the single neuron analysis. We also found that signal reliability in the FEF did not change with task demands, and overall, behavioral accuracy across the search tasks was approximated when only six trials or neurons were combined. Furthermore, whether combining trials or neurons, the increase in time of target discrimination corresponded to the increase in mean saccade latency across visual search difficulty levels. Finally, the variance of spike counts in the FEF increased as a function of the mean spike count, and the parameters of this relationship did not change with attentional selection.},

	Abstract = {We examined how the distribution of colors in natural images varies as the seasons change. Images of natural outdoor scenes were acquired at locations in the Western Ghats, India, during monsoon and winter seasons and in the Sierra Nevada, USA, from spring to fall. The images were recorded with an RGB digital camera calibrated to yield estimates of the L, M, and S cone excitations and chromatic and luminance contrasts at each pixel. These were compared across time and location and were analyzed separately for regions of earth and sky. Seasonal climate changes alter both the average color in scenes and how the colors are distributed around the average. Arid periods are marked by a mean shift toward the +L pole of the L vs. M chromatic axis and a rotation in the color distributions away from the S vs. LM chromatic axis and toward an axis of bluish-yellowish variation, both primarily due to changes in vegetation. The form of the change was similar at the two locations suggesting that the color statistics of natural images undergo a characteristic pattern of temporal variation. We consider the implications of these changes for models of both visual sensitivity and color appearance.},

	Abstract = {Eye movements can be broadly classified into target-selecting and gaze-stabilizing eye movements. How do the different systems interact under natural conditions? Here we investigate interactions between the optokinetic and the target-selecting system in cats and humans. We use combinations of natural and grating stimuli. The natural stimuli are movies and pictures taken from the cat's own point of view with a head-mounted camera while it moved about freely in an outdoor environment. We superimpose linear global motion on the stimuli and use measurements of optokinetic nystagmus as a probe to study the interaction between the different systems responsible for controlling eye movements. Cats display higher precision stabilizing eye movements in response to natural pictures as compared to drifting gratings. In contrast, humans perform similarly under these two conditions. This suggests an interaction of the optokinetic and the pursuit system. In cats, the natural movies elicit very weak optokinetic responses. In humans, by contrast, the natural movie stimuli elicit effectively stabilizing eye movements. In both species, we find a unimodal distribution of saccades for all stimulus velocities. This suggests an early interaction of target-selecting and gaze-stabilizing saccades. Thus, we argue for a more integrated view in humans of the different eye movement systems.},

	Abstract = {The spatiotemporal dynamics of the sensory response in layer 2/3 of primary somatosensory cortex evoked by a single brief whisker deflection was investigated by simultaneous voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) imaging and whole-cell (WC) voltage recordings in the anesthetized rat combined with reconstructions of dendritic and axonal arbors of L2/3 pyramids. Single and dual WC recordings from pyramidal cells indicated a strong correlation between the local VSD population response and the simultaneously measured subthreshold postsynaptic potential changes in both amplitude and time course. The earliest VSD response was detected 10-12 msec after whisker deflection centered above the barrel isomorphic to the stimulated principal whisker. It was restricted horizontally to the size of a single barrel-column coextensive with the dendritic arbor of barrel-column-related pyramids in L2/3. The horizontal spread of excitation remained confined to a single barrel-column with weak whisker deflection. With intermediate deflections, excitation spread into adjacent barrel-columns, propagating twofold more rapidly along the rows of the barrel field than across the arcs, consistent with the preferred axonal arborizations in L2/3 of reconstructed pyramidal neurons. Finally, larger whisker deflections evoked excitation spreading over the entire barrel field within approximately 50 msec before subsiding over the next approximately 250 msec. Thus the subthreshold cortical map representing a whisker deflection is dynamic on the millisecond time scale and strongly depends on stimulus strength. The sequential spatiotemporal activation of the excitatory neuronal network in L2/3 by a simple sensory stimulus can thus be accounted for primarily by the columnar restriction of L4 to L2/3 excitatory connections and the axonal field of barrel-related pyramids.},

The first experiment shows that the typical pattern of reaction time (RT) effects, namely early facilitation and later inhibition of return (IOR), can be obtained using a color change as exogenous cue and a direction change as target. In the second experiment, we manipulated the validity of the cue independently with respect to location and feature using transparent motion stimuli. Facilitation of RTs with short cue-target interstimulus-intervals (ISIs) was only evident for targets with both the valid location and the valid feature. Furthermore, at longer cue-target intervals, RTs were prolonged for targets at the cued location, irrespective of the cued feature. These results demonstrate spatial and feature-based components of early facilitation and purely spatial IOR.},

	Abstract = {Previous research has shown that visually responsive neurons in the frontal eye field of macaque monkeys select the target for a saccade during efficient, pop-out visual search through suppression of the representation of the nontarget distractors. For a fraction of these neurons, the magnitude of this distractor suppression varied with the proximity of the target to the receptive field, exhibiting more suppression of the distractor representation when the target was nearby than when the target was distant. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the variation of distractor suppression related to target proximity varied with target-distractor feature similarity. The effect of target proximity on distractor suppression did not vary with target-distractor similarity and therefore may be an endogenous property of the selection process.},

	Abstract = {It is often suggested that efficient neural codes for natural visual information should be 'sparse'. However, the term 'sparse' has been used in two different ways--firstly to describe codes in which few neurons are active at any time ('population sparseness'), and secondly to describe codes in which each neuron's lifetime response distribution has high kurtosis ('lifetime sparseness'). Although these ideas are related, they are not identical, and the most common measure of lifetime sparseness--the kurtosis of the lifetime response distributions of the neurons--provides no information about population sparseness. We have measured the population sparseness and lifetime kurtosis of several biologically inspired coding schemes. We used three measures of population sparseness (population kurtosis, Treves-Rolls sparseness and 'activity sparseness'), and found them to be in close agreement with one another. However, we also measured the lifetime kurtosis of the cells in each code. We found that lifetime kurtosis is uncorrelated with population sparseness for the codes we used. Lifetime kurtosis is not, therefore, a useful measure of the population sparseness of a code. Moreover, the Gabor-like codes, which are often assumed to have high population sparseness (since they have high lifetime kurtosis), actually turned out to have rather low population sparseness. Surprisingly, principal components filters produced the codes with the highest population sparseness.},

	Abstract = {In two sessions with free scanning and memory instructions, eye-movement patterns from nine artists were compared with those of nine artistically untrained participants viewing 16 pictures representing a selection of categories from ordinary scenes to abstraction: 12 pictures were made to accommodate an object-oriented viewing mode (selection of recognisable objects), and a pictorial viewing mode (selection of more structural features), and 4 were abstract. The artistically untrained participants showed preference for viewing human features and objects, while the artists spent more scanning time on structural/abstract features. A group by session interaction showed a change of viewing strategy in the artists, who viewed more objects and human features in the memory task session. A verbal test of recall memory showed no overall difference in the number of pictures remembered, but the number of correctly remembered pictorial features was significantly higher for artists than for the artistically untrained viewers, irrespective of picture type. No differences in fixation frequencies/durations were found between groups across sessions, but a significant task-dependent-group by session interaction of fixation frequency/duration showed that the artistically untrained participants demonstrated repetition effects in fewer, longer fixations with repeated viewing, while the opposite pattern obtained for the artists.},

	Abstract = {High-level sensory neurons encoding natural stimuli are not well described by linear models operating on the time-varying stimulus intensity. Here we show that firing rates of neurons in a secondary sensory forebrain area can be better modeled by linear functions of how surprising the stimulus is. We modeled auditory neurons in the caudal lateral mesopallium (CLM) of adult male zebra finches under urethane anesthesia with linear filters convolved not with stimulus intensity, but with stimulus surprise. Surprise was quantified as the logarithm of the probability of the stimulus given the local recent stimulus history and expectations based on conspecific song. Using our surprise method, the predictions of neural responses to conspecific song improved by 67% relative to those obtained using stimulus intensity. Similar prediction improvements cannot be replicated by assuming CLM performs derivative detection. The explanatory power of surprise increased from the midbrain through the primary forebrain and to CLM. When the stimulus presented was a random synthetic ripple noise, CLM neurons (but not neurons in lower auditory areas) were best described as if they were expecting conspecific song, finding the inconsistencies between birdsong and noise surprising. In summary, spikes in CLM neurons indicate stimulus surprise more than they indicate stimulus intensity features. The concept of stimulus surprise may be useful for modeling neural responses in other higher-order sensory areas whose functions have been poorly understood.},

	Abstract = {Increased fruit and vegetable consumption is associated with a decreased incidence of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and other chronic diseases. The beneficial health effects of fruits and vegetables have been attributed, in part, to antioxidant flavonoids present in these foods. Large, transient increases in the total antioxidant capacity of plasma have often been observed after the consumption of flavonoid-rich foods by humans. These observations led to the hypothesis that dietary flavonoids play a significant role as antioxidants in vivo, thereby reducing chronic disease risk. This notion, however, has been challenged recently by studies on the bioavailability of flavonoids, which indicate that they reach only very low concentrations in human plasma after the consumption of flavonoid-rich foods. In addition, most flavonoids are extensively metabolized in vivo, which can affect their antioxidant capacity. Furthermore, fruits and vegetables contain many macro- and micronutrients, in addition to flavonoids, that may directly or through their metabolism affect the total antioxidant capacity of plasma. In this article, we critically review the published research in this field with the goal to assess the contribution of dietary flavonoids to the total antioxidant capacity of plasma in humans. We conclude that the large increase in plasma total antioxidant capacity observed after the consumption of flavonoid-rich foods is not caused by the flavonoids themselves, but is likely the consequence of increased uric acid levels.},

	Abstract = {It has been proposed that sensory neurons are adapted to the statistical structure of the natural environment in order to encode natural stimuli efficiently. While spatiotemporal correlations in luminance signals may be decorrelated by neurons in early visual processing stages, higher-order correlations, such as those in the orientation domain, are likely to persist in the input representation until the cortical level. In this study, we first examine orientation correlations in natural stimuli across brief time intervals and across nearby regions of space, and find strong correlations in both domains. We then examine contextual modulation of orientation tuning. We find that both temporal and spatial contexts exert a common influence on orientation tuning, shifting tuning away from the orientation of either the adapting (temporal) or surrounding (spatial) grating. Finally, we incorporate this context-mediated repulsive shift in orientation tuning into a model of cortical responses. We find that a direct result of the shift is a reduction of the redundancy in the population responses evoked by the orientation configurations that are most common in natural stimuli. Thus, cortical neurons may be adapted to the statistics of orientation in natural stimuli in order to increase the efficiency of natural stimulus representation.},

	Abstract = {Understanding the guiding principles of sensory coding strategies is a main goal in computational neuroscience. Among others, the principles of predictive coding and slowness appear to capture aspects of sensory processing. Predictive coding postulates that sensory systems are adapted to the structure of their input signals such that information about future inputs is encoded. Slow feature analysis (SFA) is a method for extracting slowly varying components from quickly varying input signals, thereby learning temporally invariant features. Here, we use the information bottleneck method to state an information-theoretic objective function for temporally local predictive coding. We then show that the linear case of SFA can be interpreted as a variant of predictive coding that maximizes the mutual information between the current output of the system and the input signal in the next time step. This demonstrates that the slowness principle and predictive coding are intimately related.},

	Abstract = {Neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) respond in well defined ways to stimuli within their classical receptive field, but these responses can be modified by stimuli overlying the surrounding area. For example patch-suppressed cells respond to gratings of a specific orientation within their classical receptive field, but the response diminishes if the grating is expanded to cover the surrounding area. We report here more complex effects in many such cells. When stimulated at their optimal orientation, introducing a surrounding field at a significantly different (for example, orthogonal) orientation enhanced their output by both a disinhibitory mechanism and an active facilitatory mechanism producing 'supra-optimal' responses. Importantly, some cells responded well if the orientations of centre and surround stimuli were swapped. The output reflected the discontinuity because neither stimulus component alone was effective. Under these stimulus conditions simultaneously recorded cells with orthogonally oriented receptive fields showed correlated firing consistent with neuronal binding to the configuration. We propose a mechanism integrating orientation-dependent information over adjacent areas of visual space to represent focal orientation discontinuities such as junctions or corners.},

	Abstract = {The majority of synapses in the mammalian cortex originate from cortical neurons. Indeed, the largest input to cortical cells comes from neighboring excitatory cells. However, most models of cortical development and processing do not reflect the anatomy and physiology of feedback excitation and are restricted to serial feedforward excitation. This report describes how populations of neurons in cat visual cortex can use excitatory feedback, characterized as an effective "network conductance", to amplify their feedforward input signals and demonstrates how neuronal discharge can be kept proportional to stimulus strength despite strong, recurrent connections that threaten to cause runaway excitation. These principles are incorporated into models of cortical direction and orientation selectivity that emphasize the basic design principles of cortical architectures.},

@article{baumgartner2008a,
	Abstract = {Trust and betrayal of trust are ubiquitous in human societies. Recent behavioral evidence shows that the neuropeptide oxytocin increases trust among humans, thus offering a unique chance of gaining a deeper understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying trust and the adaptation to breach of trust. We examined the neural circuitry of trusting behavior by combining the intranasal, double-blind, administration of oxytocin with fMRI. We find that subjects in the oxytocin group show no change in their trusting behavior after they learned that their trust had been breached several times while subjects receiving placebo decrease their trust. This difference in trust adaptation is associated with a specific reduction in activation in the amygdala, the midbrain regions, and the dorsal striatum in subjects receiving oxytocin, suggesting that neural systems mediating fear processing (amygdala and midbrain regions) and behavioral adaptations to feedback information (dorsal striatum) modulate oxytocin's effect on trust. These findings may help to develop deeper insights into mental disorders such as social phobia and autism, which are characterized by persistent fear or avoidance of social interactions.},

	Abstract = {Forty years ago, von Bekesy demonstrated that the spatial source of an odorant is determined by comparing input across nostrils, but it is unknown how this comparison is effected in the brain. To address this, we delivered odorants to the left or right of the nose, and contrasted olfactory left versus right localization with olfactory identification during brain imaging. We found nostril-specific responses in primary olfactory cortex that were predictive of the accuracy of left versus right localization, thus providing a neural substrate for the behavior described by von Bekesy. Additionally, left versus right localization preferentially engaged a portion of the superior temporal gyrus previously implicated in visual and auditory localization, suggesting that localization information extracted from smell was then processed in a convergent brain system for spatial representation of multisensory inputs.},

@article{foulsham2007a,
	Abstract = {Salience-map models have been taken to suggest that the locations of eye fixations are determined by the extent of the low-level discontinuities in an image. While such models have found some support, an increasing emphasis on the task viewers are performing implies that these models must combine with cognitive demands to describe how the eyes are guided efficiently. An experiment is reported in which eye movements to objects in photographs were examined while viewers performed a memory-encoding task or one of two search tasks. The objects depicted in the scenes had known salience ranks according to a popular model. Participants fixated higher-salience objects sooner and more often than lower-salience objects, but only when memorising scenes. This difference shows that salience-map models provide useful predictions even in complex scenes and late in viewing. However, salience had no effects when searching for a target defined by category or exemplar. The results suggest that salience maps are not used to guide the eyes in these tasks, that cognitive override by task demands can be total, and that modelling top-down search is important but may not be easily accomplished within a salience-map framework.},

This provides evidence that the enhancement of stimulus salience observed in electrophysiological studies creates an enhanced perceptual representation of attended stimuli.},

	Abstract = {What are the visual causes, rather than mere correlates, of attentional selection and how do they compare to each other during natural vision? To address these questions, we first strung together semantically unrelated dynamic scenes into MTV-style video clips, and performed eye tracking experiments with human observers. We then quantified predictions of saccade target selection based on seven bottom-up models, including intensity variance, orientation contrast, intensity contrast, color contrast, flicker contrast, motion contrast, and integrated saliency. On average, all tested models predicted saccade target selection well above chance. Dynamic models were particularly predictive of saccades that were most likely bottom-up driven-initiated shortly after scene onsets, leading to maximal inter-observer similarity. Static models showed mixed results in these circumstances, with intensity variance and orientation contrast featuring particularly weak prediction accuracy (lower than their own average, and approximately 4 times lower than dynamic models). These results indicate that dynamic visual cues play a dominant causal role in attracting attention. In comparison, some static visual cues play a weaker causal role, while other static cues are not causal at all, and may instead reflect top-down causes.},

	Abstract = {The vomeronasal organ (VNO) of mammals plays an essential role in the detection of pheromones. We obtained simultaneous recordings of action potentials from large subsets of VNO neurons. These cells responded to components of urine by increasing their firing rate. This chemosensory activation required phospholipase C function. Unlike most other sensory neurons, VNO neurons did not adapt under prolonged stimulus exposure. The full time course of the VNO spiking response is captured by a simple quantitative model of ligand binding. Many individual VNO neurons were strongly selective for either male or female mouse urine, with the effective concentrations differing as much as a thousandfold. These results establish a framework for understanding sensory coding in the vomeronasal system.},

	Abstract = {In the cerebral cortex of mammals, horizontal connections link cells up to several millimeters apart. In primary visual cortex (V1) of mammals with orientation maps, horizontal connections ramify in periodic patches across the cortical surface, connecting cells with similar orientation preferences. Rodents have orientation-selective cells but lack orientation maps, raising questions about relationships of horizontal connections to functional maps and receptive field properties. To address these questions, we studied anatomy of horizontal connections and characterized horizontal functional interactions in V1 of the gray squirrel, a highly visual rodent. Long-range intrinsic connections in squirrel V1 extended 1-2 mm but were not patchy or periodic. This result suggests that periodic and patchy connectivity is not a universal organizing principle of cortex, and the existence of patchy and periodic connectivity and functional maps may be linked. In multielectrode and intracellular recordings, we found evidence of unselective local interactions among cells, similar to pinwheel centers of carnivores. These data suggest that, in mammals with and without orientation maps, local connections link near neighbors without regard to orientation selectivity. In single-unit recordings, we found length-summing and end-stopped cells that were similar to those in other mammals. Length-summing cell surrounds were orientation selective, whereas surrounds of end-stopped cells were not. Receptive field response classes are quite similar across mammals, and therefore patchy and columnar connectivity may not be essential for these properties.},

@article{eichhorn2009a,
	Abstract = {Orientation selectivity is the most striking feature of simple cell coding in V1 that has been shown to emerge from the reduction of higher-order correlations in natural images in a large variety of statistical image models. The most parsimonious one among these models is linear Independent Component Analysis (ICA), whereas second-order decorrelation transformations such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) do not yield oriented filters. Because of this finding, it has been suggested that the emergence of orientation selectivity may be explained by higher-order redundancy reduction. To assess the tenability of this hypothesis, it is an important empirical question how much more redundancy can be removed with ICA in comparison to PCA or other second-order decorrelation methods. Although some previous studies have concluded that the amount of higher-order correlation in natural images is generally insignificant, other studies reported an extra gain for ICA of more than 100%. A consistent conclusion about the role of higher-order correlations in natural images can be reached only by the development of reliable quantitative evaluation methods. Here, we present a very careful and comprehensive analysis using three evaluation criteria related to redundancy reduction: In addition to the multi-information and the average log-loss, we compute complete rate-distortion curves for ICA in comparison with PCA. Without exception, we find that the advantage of the ICA filters is small. At the same time, we show that a simple spherically symmetric distribution with only two parameters can fit the data significantly better than the probabilistic model underlying ICA. This finding suggests that, although the amount of higher-order correlation in natural images can in fact be significant, the feature of orientation selectivity does not yield a large contribution to redundancy reduction within the linear filter bank models of V1 simple cells.},

	Abstract = {AIM: To allow radioiodine (RAI) treatment in patients with need for anti-thyroid drug medication and low RAI uptakes we investigated the feasibility of discontinuing carbimazole for 3 days to enhance the RAI uptake without concurrent exacerbation of hyperthyroidism. METHODS: We prospectively investigated RAI dynamics and thyroid hormone concentration in 12 patients with low RAI uptake (<30%) under simultaneous carbimazole medication and 3 days after discontinuation. At both time points fT(4), T(3) and TSH were monitored. RESULTS: Discontinuation of carbimazole for 3 days led to a significant increase of RAI uptake in all patients. We found an enhancement up to 4.9-fold compared to the measurement on carbimazole. The mean RAI uptake increased from 15.2 +/- 4.4% to 50.1 +/- 15.5% (p<0.001). The intrapersonal radioiodine half-life increased from 4.2 +/- 1.6 days to 5.4 +/- 0.7 days (p = 0.13). Mean thyroid hormone concentration was not affected by the three day withdrawal of anti-thyroid drugs and no patient suffered from an aggravation of biochemical hyperthyroidism. CONCLUSION: A withdrawal of carbimazole for 3 days is long enough to provide sufficiently high RAI uptakes for RAI treatment in patients with low RAI uptakes and short enough to avoid the risk of exacerbation of hyperthyroidism.},

	Abstract = {Threshold and saturation are two nonlinear features common to almost all spiking neurons. How these nonlinearities affect the performance gain of the transfer function and coding properties of the neurons has attracted much attention. Here, we deduce basic analytical relationships among these nonlinearities (threshold and saturation), performance gain and information transmission in neurons. We found that performance gain and information transmission can be maximized by input signals with optimal variance. The threshold and saturation inside the model determines the gain tuning property and maximum coding capacity. This framework provides an understanding of some basic design principles underlying information processing systems that can be adjusted to match the statistics of signals in the environment. This study also isolates the exact contributions of the nonlinearities on the contrast adaptation phenomena observed in real visual neurons.},

	Abstract = {The visibility of gratings improves with increasing stimulus area. This effect is usually interpreted as being due to probability summation between the outputs of linear, independent spatial filters, although non-linear spatial summation can have similar effects [1]. In order to distinguish between probabilistic and physiological summation models, we measured contrast thresholds using the Visual Evoked Potential (VEP). Our previous work [2] suggests that spatial summation in the VEP is nonlinear and that it occurs preferentially for collinear configurations. Traditional probability summation models predict that areal summation will improve threshold independent of stimulus configuration. Contrast thresholds were derived from VEP contrast response functions for either circular or elongated Gabor patches with aspect ratios up to 6:1. The carrier orientation was either the same as the patch envelope orientation (collinear) or orthogonal to it. Response amplitudes were larger and contrast sensitivity was higher for collinear configurations. The results are consistent with nonlinear, configuration dependent summation that is more extensive along the axis of orientation.},

@article{zen2007a,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hyperthyroidism is a disease in which excessive amounts of thyroid hormones circulate in the blood. Patients, among other things suffer from tachycardia, warm moist skin and raised body temperature. The treatment of hyperthyroidism includes symptom relief and therapy with antithyroid medications, radioiodine and thyroidectomy. Medicinal herbs are used alone or in combination with antithyroid agents to treat hyperthyroidism in China and some other countries. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of Chinese herbal medicines for treating hyperthyroidism. SEARCH STRATEGY: Studies were obtained from computerised searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, the Chinese Biomedical Database. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials comparing the effects of Chinese herbal medicines alone with Chinese herbal medicines combined with antithyroid drugs, radioiodine or both. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three authors interviewed authors of all potentially relevant studies by telephone to verify randomisation procedures. One author entered data into a data extraction form and another author verified the results of this procedure. MAIN RESULTS: Thirteen relevant trials with 1770 participants were included. All of them were of low quality. Fifty-two studies still need to be assessed because the original authors could not be interviewed. None of these trials analysed mortality, health related quality of life, economic outcomes or compliance. Compared to antithyroid drugs alone the results showed that Chinese herbal medicines combined with antithyroid drugs may offer benefits in lowering relapse rates, reducing the incidence of adverse effects, relieving symptoms, improving thyroid antibody status and thyroid function. Two trials investigated Chinese herbal medicine versus radioiodine and reported improvements in anxiety, tachycardia and heat intolerance. However, thyroid function - with the exception of restored thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) - was not significantly altered. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that traditional Chinese herbal medicines added to other routine treatment have a therapeutic potential for people with hyperthyroidism. However, due to methodological limitations, we could not identify a well-designed trial to provide strong evidence for Chinese traditional herbal medicine in the treatment of hyperthyroidism. Thus, we currently cannot recommend any single preparation or formulation for clinical use.},

@article{wang2003a,
	Abstract = {Extensive attempts have been made to explain the neurobiological basis of the greater sensitivity of the visual system to vertically or horizontally oriented information than to information presented at oblique angles. However, investigators have largely ignored the overlap of the representation of a given angle with the representation of nearby angles. Recordings based on intrinsic optical signals were obtained in area 17 from 12 adult cats during the presentation of contours in various orientations. A method investigating both amplitude and statistical significance of changes was proposed to evaluate the orientation tuning properties for cell populations in the central area retinotopically corresponding to 0-15 degrees of visual field. Cardinal orientations were found to activate significantly greater areas in the exposed cortical area than the areas activated by oblique orientations. Areas activated by cardinal or oblique contours and those separated from them by 10 degrees were compared. A significantly lower degree of overlap was seen between areas activated by presentation of cardinal contours and areas activated by neighboring orientations compared with those for oblique orientations which overlapped more extensively with neighboring orientations. In addition, areas activated only by cardinal contours were significantly larger than areas activated only by oblique contours. These results demonstrated in cell population level that more cells prefer horizontal or vertical orientations, and these cells are tuned more sharply than oblique selective cells.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence demonstrates that motor-skill memories improve across a night of sleep, and that non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep commonly plays a role in orchestrating these consolidation enhancements. Here we show the benefit of a daytime nap on motor memory consolidation and its relationship not simply with global sleep-stage measures, but unique characteristics of sleep spindles at regionally specific locations; mapping to the corresponding memory representation. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Two groups of subjects trained on a motor-skill task using their left hand - a paradigm known to result in overnight plastic changes in the contralateral, right motor cortex. Both groups trained in the morning and were tested 8 hr later, with one group obtaining a 60-90 minute intervening midday nap, while the other group remained awake. At testing, subjects that did not nap showed no significant performance improvement, yet those that did nap expressed a highly significant consolidation enhancement. Within the nap group, the amount of offline improvement showed a significant correlation with the global measure of stage-2 NREM sleep. However, topographical sleep spindle analysis revealed more precise correlations. Specifically, when spindle activity at the central electrode of the non-learning hemisphere (left) was subtracted from that in the learning hemisphere (right), representing the homeostatic difference following learning, strong positive relationships with offline memory improvement emerged-correlations that were not evident for either hemisphere alone. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results demonstrate that motor memories are dynamically facilitated across daytime naps, enhancements that are uniquely associated with electrophysiological events expressed at local, anatomically discrete locations of the brain.},

	Abstract = {In popout search, humans and monkeys are affected by trial-to-trial changes in stimulus features and target location. The neuronal mechanisms underlying such sequential effects have not been examined. Single neurons were recorded in the frontal eye field (FEF) of monkeys performing a popout search during which stimulus features and target position changed unpredictably across trials. Like previous studies, repetition of stimulus features improved performance. This feature-based facilitation of return was manifested in the target discrimination process in FEF: neurons discriminated the target from distractors earlier and better with repetition of stimulus features, corresponding to improvements in saccade latency and accuracy, respectively. The neuronal target selection was mediated by both target enhancement and distractor suppression. In contrast to the repetition of features, repetition of target position increased saccade latency. This location-based inhibition of return was reflected in the neuronal discrimination process but not in the baseline activity in FEF. These results show adjustments of the target selection process in FEF corresponding to and therefore possibly contributing to changes in performance across trials caused by sequential regularities in display properties.},

	Abstract = {We propose a sequential information maximization model as a general strategy for programming eye movements. The model reconstructs high-resolution visual information from a sequence of fixations, taking into account the fall-off in resolution from the fovea to the periphery. From this framework we get a simple rule for predicting fixation sequences: after each fixation, fixate next at the location that minimizes uncertainty (maximizes information) about the stimulus. By comparing our model performance to human eye movement data and to predictions from a saliency and random model, we demonstrate that our model is best at predicting fixation locations. Modeling additional biological constraints will improve the prediction of fixation sequences. Our results suggest that information maximization is a useful principle for programming eye movements.},

Empirical research has demonstrated, however, that people will take into account the interests of others and are sensitive to norms of cooperation and fairness. In one of the most robust tests of this finding, the ultimatum game, individuals will reject a proposed division of a monetary windfall, at a cost to themselves, if they perceive it as unfair. Here we show that in an ultimatum game, humans' closest living relatives, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), are rational maximizers and are not sensitive to fairness. These results support the hypothesis that other-regarding preferences and aversion to inequitable outcomes, which play key roles in human social organization, distinguish us from our closest living relatives.},

Organisms face nearly the opposite task--extracting information about an unknown time-dependent stimulus from short segments of a spike train. Here the neural code was characterized from the point of view of the organism, culminating in algorithms for real-time stimulus estimation based on a single example of the spike train.

Such decoding experiments determined the effective noise level and fault tolerance of neural computation, and the structure of the decoding algorithms suggested a simple model for real-time analog signal processing with spiking neurons.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The study aims to evaluate the efficacy of combination therapy with propylthiouracil (PTU) and cholestyramine in the treatment of Graves' hyperthyroidism. BACKGROUND: Thyroxine (T4) is metabolized mainly in the liver by conjugation to glucuronides and sulphates that enter the enterohepatic circulation. Thyrotoxic patients have an abnormal increase in thyroid hormone in their enterohepatic circulation. Previous studies on combination therapy with methimazole and cholestyramine for Graves' hyperthyroidism have shown it to be an effective adjunctive treatment. In this study, we examined the efficacy of combination therapy with PTU and cholestyramine in the treatment of Graves' hyperthyroidism. METHODS: Thirty patients with newly diagnosed Graves' hyperthyroidism were randomly divided into two groups: group I (n = 15) received PTU 100 mg twice a day, propranolol 40 mg twice a day and cholestyramine 4 g twice a day for 4 weeks; group II (n = 15) received PTU 100 mg twice a day and propranolol 40 mg twice a day for 4 weeks. The therapeutic efficacy was determined by serum total triiodothyronine (TT3), free thyroxine (FT4) and TRAb levels at baseline, and at the end of 2 and 4 weeks during the study period. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in baseline thyroid function parameters. At the end of 2 and 4 weeks of the study period, serum TT3 and FT4 levels of group I were significantly lower than those of group II. No significant differences in the TRAb level were found between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Cholestyramine contributed to a more rapid and complete decline in thyroid hormone levels in patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism. It was thus proved to be an effective and well-tolerated adjunctive therapy.},

	Abstract = {A biologically motivated computational model of bottom-up visual selective attention was used to examine the degree to which stimulus salience guides the allocation of attention. Human eye movements were recorded while participants viewed a series of digitized images of complex natural and artificial scenes. Stimulus dependence of attention, as measured by the correlation between computed stimulus salience and fixation locations, was found to be significantly greater than that expected by chance alone and furthermore was greatest for eye movements that immediately follow stimulus onset. The ability to guide attention of three modeled stimulus features (color, intensity and orientation) was examined and found to vary with image type. Additionally, the effect of the drop in visual sensitivity as a function of eccentricity on stimulus salience was examined, modeled, and shown to be an important determiner of attentional allocation. Overall, the results indicate that stimulus-driven, bottom-up mechanisms contribute significantly to attentional guidance under natural viewing conditions.},

	Abstract = {Horseradish peroxidase was injected intracellularly into single, physiologically identified X- and Y-cell geniculocortical axons that projected to area 18, to the 17/18 border region, or to both areas 17 and 18 via branching axons. The axon terminal fields in cortex were labeled anterogradely, and the cell bodies of the axons in the A-laminae, lamina C, and the medial interlaminar nucleus (MIN) of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) were labeled retrogradely. The laminar projections in area 18 of eight Y-cells and one geniculate, non-Y-cell were analyzed. Most of the cells arborized densely within layer IVa and the lower 200 to 400 microns of layer III. Most provided little or no input to layer IVb or layer VI. Thus, the laminar projections of Y-cells to layer IV of area 18 were similar to those of their area 17 counterparts, although the input to layer III was greater and rose much higher in area 18 than in area 17. The terminal arbors in area 18 were two to three times larger in lateral extent than those in area 17. They spread over 2.0 to 2.8 mm2 of layer IV and occupied proportionately much greater regions of area 18 than the Y-cell arbors in area 17. This may partially account for the large receptive fields of cortical cells in area 18, and it indicates that a small region of area 18 may receive converging inputs from a relatively wide retinotopic region of the LGN. The terminal arbors were also highly asymmetric, generally being two to four times longer anteroposteriorly than mediolaterally. These asymmetric arbors may form the structural basis for the anisotropic organization of the retinotopic map in area 18. We recovered three cells (two Y, one X) whose axons arborized in the border zone between areas 17 and 18. One Y-cell axon had a receptive field located in the ipsilateral visual hemifield and it arborized in a small region restricted almost exclusively to the border zone. The other two cells had receptive fields on or adjacent to the vertical meridian, and they terminated on either side of the 17/18 border region as well as within it. Thus, geniculate afferents representing the ipsilateral hemifield or the vertical meridian appear to have different patterns of termination on and adjacent to the 17/18 border zone. Also, some X-cell input may invade area 18 in the region immediately adjacent to the border zone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	Abstract = {Due to fixational eye movements, the image on the retina is always in motion, even when one views a stationary scene. When an object moves within the scene, the corresponding patch of retina experiences a different motion trajectory than the surrounding region. Certain retinal ganglion cells respond selectively to this condition, when the motion in the cell's receptive field center is different from that in the surround. Here we show that this response is strongest at the very onset of differential motion, followed by gradual adaptation with a time course of several seconds. Different subregions of a ganglion cell's receptive field can adapt independently. The circuitry responsible for differential motion adaptation lies in the inner retina. Several candidate mechanisms were tested, and the adaptation most likely results from synaptic depression at the synapse from bipolar to ganglion cell. Similar circuit mechanisms may act more generally to emphasize novel features of a visual stimulus.},

@article{lowel1998a,
	Abstract = {Abstract In the primary visual cortex of strabismic cats, the elimination of correlated activity between the two eyes enhances the segregation of the geniculocortical afferents into alternating ocular dominance domains. In addition, both tangential intracortical fibres and neuronal synchronization are severely reduced between neurons activated by different eyes. Consequently, ocular dominance columns belonging to different eyes are functionally rather independent. We wondered whether this would also affect the organization of orientation preference maps. To this end, we visualized the functional architecture of area 17 of strabismic cats with both optical imaging based on intrinsic signals and double labelling of orientation and ocular dominance columns with {\$}[{\$}14C{\$}]{\$}2-deoxyglucose and {\$}[{\$}3H{\$}]{\$}proline. As expected, monocular iso-orientation domains had a patchy appearance and differed for the two eyes, leading to a clear segregation of the ocular dominance domains. Comparison of 'angle maps' revealed that orientation domains exhibit a pinwheel organization as in normally reared cats. Interestingly, the map of orientation preferences did not show any breaks at the borders between ocular dominance columns: iso-orientation domains were continuous across these borders. In addition, iso-orientation contours tended to cross the borders of adjacent ocular dominance columns at right angles. These data suggest that the basic relations between the layout of orientation maps and ocular dominance columns are not disturbed by artificial decorrelation of binocular input. Therefore in cat area 17, the orientation map does not seem to be modified by experience-dependent changes of thalamic input connections. This suggests the possibility that use-dependent rearrangement of geniculocortical afferents into ocular dominance columns is due to Hebbian modifications whereby postsynaptic responsivity is constrained by the scaffold of the orientation map.},

	Abstract = {There is a great deal of structural regularity in the natural environment, and such regularities confer an opportunity to form compressed, efficient representations. Although this concept has been extensively studied within the domain of low-level sensory coding, there has been limited focus on efficient coding in the field of visual attention. Here we show that spatial patterns of orientation information ("spatial ensemble statistics") can be efficiently encoded under conditions of reduced attention. In our task, observers monitored for changes to the spatial pattern of background elements while they were attentively tracking moving objects in the foreground. By using stimuli that enable us to dissociate changes in local structure from changes in the ensemble structure, we found that observers were more sensitive to changes to the background that altered the ensemble structure than to changes that did not alter the ensemble structure. We propose that reducing attention to the background increases the amount of noise in local feature representations, but that spatial ensemble statistics capitalize on structural regularities to overcome this noise by pooling across local measurements, gaining precision in the representation of the ensemble.},

@article{mannan1996a,
	Abstract = {The locations of features such as extremes of contrast or luminance, high spatial frequency content and edge density in a set of images have been determined, and the locations of fixations made by a group of eighteen human observers who examined the images during brief (3 s) presentations were also measured. The similarity between the locations of the eye movements and those of each stimulus feature was determined by means of a least squares index IS. For averages taken over data for all observers, the similarity determined in this way is much lower than values for pairs of fixation locations made by different observers. It is concluded that the pattern of fixations made to a given image which is highly conserved between different observers, cannot be associated with any one of the local features examined by us. It is shown further that the distribution of fixation locations over the images is non-uniform, with a marked bias to central areas, whereas the image features are more uniformly distributed. Weighting the distributions of feature locations to take account of the non-uniform distribution of fixations produces much higher IS values, but the dominant contribution to these high values is the weighting function itself. Only in the case of edge density is there significant similarity between the locations of eye movements and those of the image features.},

	Abstract = {Graves' disease is a significant medical condition in children. The optimal therapy is controversial. We reviewed 40 pediatric patients with Graves' disease, 5.0-17.7 yrs of age (mean 10.2 yrs), treated for at least one yr from 1990 to 2002 to assess the outcome of antithyroid medication and radioiodine therapy. The follow-up duration was 1.1-11.8 yrs (mean 5.1 yrs). Clinical variables were also analyzed to identify the prognostic factors. The 40 patients were divided into 3 groups according to their therapeutic options to analyze outcome. To identify predictors, patients who achieved remission after antithyroid drugs within 2 yrs (n = 7) were compared with those who received more than 2 yrs of medication but did not enter remission (n = 25). In group 1, 28 patients received antithyroid drugs for 0.7-10 yrs (mean 3.4 yrs). Fourteen (50%) achieved remission after 0.7-6.6 yrs (mean 2.6 yrs). In group 2, 9 patients received subsequent radioiodine therapy (10-15 mCi) after antithyroid drugs for 1.1-9.2 yrs (mean 4.4 yrs). Remission was achieved after 1-11 months (mean 3.1 months) in 8 (89%). In group 3, initial 131I (12-15 mCi) was used in 3 patients. All of them (100%) attained remission within 2 months. The overall remission rate of patients receiving medical therapy (group 1 and 2) was 38% (14/37). Of the 11 patients who achieved remission after radioiodine, 10 had hypothyroid status and required thyroxine replacement. There were no significant differences with any of the clinical variables that might predict remission after medication within 2 yrs, possibly because of the small number of patients. Our data demonstrate that radioiodine is an efficient and effective therapy for pediatric Graves' disease as first-line treatment or subsequent therapy for those with relapsed disease after medical therapy, although most patients develop hypothyroidism after treatment.},

	Abstract = {The emergence of social behaviors early in life is likely crucial for the development of mother-infant relationships. Some of these behaviors, such as the capacity of neonates to imitate adult facial movements, were previously thought to be limited to humans and perhaps the ape lineage. Here we report the behavioral responses of infant rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) to the following human facial and hand gestures: lip smacking, tongue protrusion, mouth opening, hand opening, and opening and closing of eyes (control condition). In the third day of life, infant macaques imitate lip smacking and tongue protrusion. On the first day of life, the model's mouth openings elicited a similar matched behavior (lip smacking) in the infants. These imitative responses are present at an early stage of development, but they are apparently confined to a narrow temporal window. Because lip smacking is a core gesture in face-to-face interactions in macaques, neonatal imitation may serve to tune infants' affiliative responses to the social world. Our findings provide a quantitative description of neonatal imitation in a nonhuman primate species and suggest that these imitative capacities, contrary to what was previously thought, are not unique to the ape and human lineage. We suggest that their evolutionary origins may be traced to affiliative gestures with communicative functions.},

	Abstract = {In many cortical areas, simple stimuli or task conditions activate large populations of neurons. We hypothesize that such populations support processes of interaction within parametric representations and integration of multiple sources of input and we propose to study these processes using distributions of population activation (DPAs) as a tool. Such distributions can be viewed as neuronal representations of continuous stimulus or task parameters. They are built from basis functions contributed by each neuron. These functions may be explicitly chosen based on tuning curves or receptive field profiles. Or they may be determined by minimizing the distance between chosen target distributions and the constructed DPAs. In both cases, construction of the DPA is based on a set of reference conditions in which the stimulus or task parameters are sampled experimentally. In a second step, basis functions are kept fixed, and the DPAs are used to explore time dependent processing, interaction and integration of information. For instance, stimuli which simultaneously specify multiple parameter values can be used to study interactions within the parametric representation. We review an experiment, in which the representation of retinal position is probed in this way, revealing fast excitatory interactions among neurons representing similar retinal positions and slower inhibitory interactions among neurons representing dissimilar retinal positions. Similarly, DPAs can be used to analyze different sources of input that are fused within a parametric representation. We review an experiment in which the representation of the direction of goal-directed arm movements in motor and premotor cortex is studied when prior and current information about upcoming movement tasks are integrated.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chromosomal damage, as assessed by clastogenic factors (CFs) and micronuclei (MN) appearance, after radioiodine therapy of Graves' disease has been reported. OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: Our objective was to evaluate the effect of Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb 761) supplementation on the time course (up to 120 d) of CFs and MN appearance in lymphocytes from patients with Graves' disease after iodine-131 ((131)I) therapy. Patients were randomly assigned to EGb 761 or placebo, in a blinded manner. RESULTS: In the placebo group, MN increased early (P < 0.001) after (131)I, peaking at the 21st day (P = 0.0003) and declining thereafter. In EGb 761-treated patients, MN increased early (P < 0.05), while returning toward baseline value thereafter. Therefore, mean MN increment was significantly higher in the placebo group as compared with EGb 761-treated patients (P < 0.01). Moreover, an early (P < 0.0001) and sustained (up to 35 d; P < 0.001) MN increase induced by CFs was observed in the placebo group. Conversely, in EGb 761-treated patients, MN increase induced by CFs never reached the statistical significance; therefore, the mean of the MN increments was significantly lower than in placebo (P < 0.05). A significant positive correlation between MN maximum increment and the bone marrow dose was observed in the placebo group only (P = 0.03). No significant difference was observed in clinical outcome between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: EGb 761 supplementation neutralized genotoxic damage induced by radioiodine treatment, without affecting the clinical outcome. Although (131)I therapy is generally safe, our data suggest that Gingko biloba extracts may prevent genetic effects of radioiodine therapy for hyperthyroid Graves' disease.},

	Abstract = {The appeal of in vivo cellular imaging to any neuroscientist is not hard to understand: it is almost impossible to isolate individual neurons while keeping them and their complex interactions with surrounding tissue intact. These interactions lead to the complex network dynamics that underlie neural computation which, in turn, forms the basis of cognition, perception and consciousness. In vivo imaging allows the study of both form and function in reasonably intact preparations, often with subcellular spatial resolution, a time resolution of milliseconds and a purview of months. Recently, the limits of what can be achieved in vivo have been pushed into terrain that was previously only accessible in vitro, due to advances in both physical-imaging technology and the design of molecular contrast agents.},

@article{maldonado2007a,
	Abstract = {Many studies have now demonstrated that neurons in the visual cortex of cats and monkeys change their activity when stimuli are presented beyond their classical receptive field, and that these responses are not readily apparent from their receptive field properties. However few studies have been conducted to investigate the discharge properties of neurons in the visual cortex of animals when they are allow to freely view natural images. We employ tetrodes, which enable simultaneous and separable recordings of small numbers of neighboring neurons, to record 102 single units from 59 sites from areas 17 and 18 of two alert cats. While the animals viewed either natural images or black screens, they made frequent saccadic eye movements and gaze fixations. Fixations onto an image's location increased neuronal firing peaking at 80-100 ms after the fixation onset, to then decrease steadily with time despite continuous fixation. Saccades trigger a fast decrease in firing rate for both images and darkness. When we examined the incidence of correlated firing, we observed significant synchrony during the initial phases of visual fixations when the animals viewed natural scenes. Such synchrony was absent during saccadic eye movements and during eye movements in darkness. Our data revealed that scanning of natural scenes is associated with a rapid succession of distinct fixation-related activation patterns that included transient rate changes and excess coincident firing. The transient nature of these synchronization phenomena suggests a fast acting mechanism, which is in good agreement with the evidence that basic operations of scene analysis must be accomplished within a few tens of milliseconds in primary visual cortex.},

	Abstract = {The generation of action potentials (APs) is a key process in the operation of nerve cells and the communication between neurons. Action potentials in mammalian central neurons are characterized by an exceptionally fast onset dynamics, which differs from the typically slow and gradual onset dynamics seen in identified snail neurons. Here we describe a novel method of analysis which provides a quantitative measure of the onset dynamics of action potentials. This method captures the difference between the fast, step-like onset of APs in rat neocortical neurons and the gradual, exponential-like AP onset in identified snail neurons.

The tuning properties of IFs were studied using an annular surround grating patch while an optimal centre patch was placed at the excitatory RF to continuously activate the cell. The results show that, for most cells, the orientation, spatial frequency and speed tuning of the IFs were similar to, but broader than, the tuning of the RF, whereas the direction selectivity of the IF was not as pronounced as that of the RF. The possible functional significance of the IF is discussed.},

In this article we examine two candidate neural codes: information is represented in the spike rate of neurons, or information is represented in the precise timing of individual spikes. These codes can be distinguished by examining the physiological basis of the highly irregular interspike intervals typically observed in cerebral cortex. Recent advances in our understanding of cortical microcircuitry suggest that the timing of neuronal spikes conveys little, if any, information. The cortex is likely to propagate a noisy rate code through redundant, patchy interconnections.},

Here, we seek direct evidence that the SC also contributes to the control of covert spatial attention, a process that focuses attention on a region of space different from the point of gaze. While requiring monkeys to keep their gaze fixed, we tested whether microstimulation of a specific location in the SC spatial map would enhance visual performance at the corresponding region of space, a diagnostic measure of covert attention. We find that microstimulation improves performance in a spatially selective manner: thresholds decrease at the location in visual space represented by the stimulated SC site, but not at a control location in the opposite hemifield. Our data provide direct evidence that the SC contributes to the control of covert spatial attention.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Patients with hyperthyroidism occasionally need rapid restoration to the euthyroid state. In view of the increased enterohepatic circulation of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) in thyrotoxicosis, and metabolic effects of konjac glucomannan in gastrointestinal system, we aimed to determine the activity of glucomannan in treatment of hyperthyroidism. METHODS: A prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, one-blind study design was used with newly diagnosed 48 hyperthyroid patients (30 patients with Graves' disease and 12 with multinodulary goitre). They were assigned to one of the following treatment groups: I) methimazole 2 x 10 mg, propranolol 2 x 20 mg, and glucomannan (Propol) 2 x 1.3 gr daily for two months; II) methimazole 2 x 10 mg, propranolol 2 x 20 mg, and placebo powder daily for two months. RESULTS: No differences were detected from the point of view of the baseline thyroid hormone levels between groups (p > 0.05). Further analyses revealed that the patients receiving glucomannan at the end of the second, fourth and sixth weeks of the study had significantly lower serum T3, T4, FT3 and FT4 levels than the patients who received placebo (p < 0.05). TSH was not different between the two groups at any specific time (p > 0.05). At week 8, thyroid hormone levels were not shown any differences. The glucomannan-treated group had a more rapid decline in all four serum thyroid hormone levels than the placebo-treated group. CONCLUSIONS: We believe our preliminary results indicate that glucomannan may be a safe and easily tolerated adjunctive therapeutic agent in the treatment of thyrotoxicosis. This combination therapy seems most effect during first weeks of treatment of a hyperthyroid patient.},

	Abstract = {Visual perspective taking research has established that chimpanzees recognize what others can or cannot see in the presence of occluding barriers. Less is known about chimpanzees' appreciation of what they themselves can or cannot see in similar situations. Additionally, it is unclear whether chimpanzees must rely on others' gaze cues to solve such tasks or whether they have a more general appreciation of what can be seen from where. Hence, we investigated chimpanzees' ability to anticipate what they would or would not be able to see from different visual perspectives. Food was hidden among arrays of open containers, with different containers providing visual access from unique viewing perspectives. Chimpanzees immediately adopted the correct perspective for each container type. Follow-up experiments showed that they were not simply moving to align themselves with visible openings. Our study thus suggests that chimpanzees have good visual perspective taking abilities with regard to themselves as well as others, and that both likely reflect a more general knowledge, at least implicit, of what can be seen from where.},

	Abstract = {A central hypothesis concerning sensory processing is that the neuronal circuits are specifically adapted to represent natural stimuli efficiently. Here we show a novel effect in cortical coding of natural images. Using spike-triggered average or spike-triggered covariance analyses, we first identified the visual features selectively represented by each cortical neuron from its responses to natural images. We then measured the neuronal sensitivity to these features when they were present in either natural images or random stimuli. We found that in the responses of complex cells, but not of simple cells, the sensitivity was markedly higher for natural images than for random stimuli. Such elevated sensitivity leads to increased detectability of the visual features and thus an improved cortical representation of natural scenes. Interestingly, this effect is due not to the spatial power spectra of natural images, but to their phase regularities. These results point to a distinct visual-coding strategy that is mediated by contextual modulation of cortical responses tuned to the spatial-phase structure of natural scenes.},

	Abstract = {Neurons in the primary visual cortex respond selectively to the orientation of edges and their direction of motion. Orientation preference is mapped in a systematic fashion across the cortical surface, such that neurons in adjacent columns have similar but slightly shifted preferred orientations. Microelectrode studies have suggested that direction preference is also arranged in a systematic fashion, but exactly how this response property is mapped remains unclear. Here we show by optical imaging of intrinsic signals in ferret cortical area 17 that there is a mosaic-like map of direction preference. This map consists of numerous regions within which direction preference changes in a slow, continuous fashion. These regions are separated by winding boundaries (fractures) across which direction preference shifts abruptly, often by 180 degrees. Comparison of direction and orientation preference maps shows that these fractures subdivide iso-orientation domains into regions selective for opposite directions of motion.},

	Abstract = {Block-replace and titration antithyroid drug regimens both give similar rates of medium- to long-term remission of hyperthyroid Graves' disease. Recent meta-analysis, however, has suggested that titration regimens may be preferable owing to a higher rate of adverse events seen in the block-replace arms of published comparative studies. This article critically re-evaluates the evidence upon which these meta-analyses were based. We suggest that there is little objective evidence that is pertinent to current clinical practice to separate block-replace from titration antithyroid drug regimens and that both remain satisfactory approaches to the medical management of hyperthyroid Graves' disease.},

	Abstract = {To investigate how neurons in cortical layer 2/3 integrate horizontal inputs arising from widely distributed sites, we combined intracellular recording and voltage-sensitive dye imaging to visualize the spatiotemporal dynamics of neuronal activity evoked by electrical stimulation of multiple sites in visual cortex. Individual stimuli evoked characteristic patterns of optical activity, while delivering stimuli at multiple sites generated interacting patterns in the regions of overlap. We observed that neurons in overlapping regions received convergent horizontal activation that generated nonlinear responses due to the emergence of large inhibitory potentials. The results indicate that co-activation of multiple sets of horizontal connections recruit strong inhibition from local inhibitory networks, causing marked deviations from simple linear integration.},

In Experiment 1, the target was either a face-shaped region (figure) or a non-face-shaped region (ground) of identical area that appeared to be the face's background. In Experiment 2, the target was a square or a trapezoid of identical area that appeared as a tilted rectangle. In Experiment 3, the target was a square surrounded by square, circular, or diamond-shaped elements. Targets that (1) were perceived as figures, (2) were phenomenally small in area, or (3) did not group well with other elements in the array because of shape appeared self-luminous at significantly lower luminance levels. These results indicate that like lightness perception, the luminosity threshold is influenced by perceptual organization and is not based on low-level retinal processes alone.},

	Abstract = {Attention and adaptation are both mechanisms that optimize visual performance. Attention optimizes performance by increasing contrast sensitivity for and neural response to attended stimuli while decreasing them for unattended stimuli; adaptation optimizes performance by increasing contrast sensitivity for and neural response to changing stimuli while decreasing them for unchanging stimuli. We investigated whether and how the adaptation state and the attentional effect on contrast sensitivity interact. We measured contrast sensitivity with an orientation-discrimination task, in two adaptation conditions--adapt to 0% or 100% contrast--in focused, distributed, and withdrawn attentional conditions. We used threshold and asymptotic performance to index the magnitude of the attentional effect--enhancement or impairment in contrast sensitivity--before and after adapting to high-contrast stimuli. The results show that attention and adaptation affect the contrast psychometric function in a similar but opposite way: Attention increases stimulus salience, whereas adaptation reduces stimulus salience. An interesting finding is that the adaptation state does not modulate the magnitude of the attentional effect. This suggests that attention affects the normalized signal once the effect of contrast adaptation has taken place and that these two mechanisms act separately to change contrast sensitivity. Attention can overcome adaptation to restore contrast sensitivity.},

	Abstract = {Whenever temporally incongruent audiovisual sequences are presented, the perceived flash rate follows the physical flutter rate. Increasing the auditory flutter rate increases the perceived flicker rate (visual illusions). Likewise, decreasing the flutter rate decreases the perceived flicker rate (visual suppressions). Here, we investigated the electrophysiological correlates of this perceptual phenomenon. Two sequences of visual flashes and auditory beeps were presented either synchronously (both visual flashes (F) and auditory beeps (B) at 3 or 5 Hz, respectively) or asynchronously at different rates (3F5B or 5F3B). Event-related potentials were acquired, while subjects reported the perceived number of flashes (response options: 3, 4, and 5). During asynchronous trials, subjects' flash counts were significantly higher when the flutter rate exceeded the flicker rate (i.e. visual illusions occurred); and lower flutter rate was below the flicker rate (i.e. visual suppressions occurred). Differential brain responses for reported illusions and suppressions (incorrect flash counts) vs. no-illusions/suppressions (correct flash counts) were found over parieto-occipital sites, followed by slow modulations over frontal and occipital areas. Importantly, the modulation over occipital electrodes starting around 500 ms had an inverse polarity for illusions vs. suppressions. These results provide evidence that both sound-induced visual illusions and suppressions are mediated by an interplay of distributed brain regions, in the attempt to fuse asynchronous audiovisual stimuli into a synchronous percept.},

	Abstract = {Little is known about the "inverse" of the receptive field--the region of cortical space whose spatiotemporal pattern of electrical activity is influenced by a given sensory stimulus. We refer to this activated area as the cortical response field, the properties of which remain unexplored. Here, the dynamics of cortical response fields evoked in visual cortex by small, local drifting-oriented gratings were explored using voltage-sensitive dyes. We found that the cortical response field was often characterized by a plateau of activity, beyond the rim of which activity diminished quickly. Plateau rim location was largely independent of stimulus orientation. However, approximately 20 ms following plateau onset, 1-3 peaks emerged on it and were amplified for 25 ms. Spiking was limited to the peak zones, whose location strongly depended on stimulus orientation. Thus, alongside selective amplification of a spatially restricted suprathreshold response, wider activation to just below threshold encompasses all orientation domains within a well-defined retinotopic vicinity of the current stimulus, priming the cortex for processing of subsequent stimuli.},

	Annote = {this is a nice easy-going paper. It is an examplar paper to understand full dynamics of the early cortical responses to simple very localized stimuli. Anything related to temporal and spatial dynamics can be found. They introduce the concept of "cortical response field" which generalizes the concept of classical receptive field. Actually classical receptive field becomes a specific case of this general case. They go on with the studies of the properties of the cortical response field to a simple localized stimuli. Shortly: Simple localized stimuli does not spatially evoke something mathematically trackable such as a gaussian shape or a mexican hat. Contrary the simple stimuli causes a peak embedded in or carried by a plateau. Within the plateau the modulatation depth (MD) increases with decreasing distance to the peak and more and more of the pixels with the orientation of the shown stimulus appear. That is in the rim of the plateau, the number of pixels with orthogonal selectivity is same as the number of pixels with their orientation selectivity same as the one shown in the screen. Concerning the temporal aspects, with the stimulus onset first emerges a plateau. The very earliest response consisted of a uniform rise in activity level within plateau rim of both the peak and plateau regions together, followed by larger/faster activation in the peak relative to the plateau. Peak VS Plateau separation happens later than the Plateau/periphery separation... Relative peak height (difference of peak and the plateau) abruptly reaches a steady state level at around 100 ms. After this time, the peak on the plateau has a nearly constant size, and the peak and plateau regions continue to rise together at an identical rate. Figure 6A. Spiking activity is confined within the peak area. HERE IS THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF THE DISCUSSION: PERFEKT Summary The main results are that at its onset, the cortical response to a local oriented grating is a flat-topped structure (Fig. 4 and supplementary movie). Response onset occurs ~40 ms after stimulus onset. Approximately 20 ms later, a peak emerges on this plateau (Fig. 5) and reaches its maximal amplitude in about 25 ms. The height of the plateau continues to increase for ~50 ms more (Fig. 6). Spiking exists at the peak zone and is absent elsewhere, both at the plateau level and in the periphery (Fig. 8 and Supplementary Figs. 2 {\&} 3). At the peak zone, most of the pixels have the appropriate preferred orientation, matching that of the inducing stimulus, whereas at plateau level, no such bias exists (Fig. 3 main panel). Although this means that pixels of all orientation preferences are located within the plateau rim, pixels with orientation preference matching the stimulus respond slightly stronger than those with orthogonal orientation preference (Fig. 3 inset). This orientation-selective ``ripple'' on the plateau allows orientation maps to emerge in response to local stimuli (Fig. 2). The total detected signal continues to slightly increase in the imaged cortical region---but in a much less localized manner---until 200--300 ms after stimulus onset (Fig. 5B). Later than this, there is an overall decrease in signal amplitude. In 3 cortical response fields (Fig. 1C, responses 7, 8, 11), we observed multiple peaks, probably due to the specific relationship between the retinotopic mapping of these specific stimuli and the local orientation map (i.e., the directly stimulated visual area contained more than a single orientation patch).},

	Abstract = {How does the brain integrate information from different senses into a unitary percept? What factors influence such multisensory integration? Using a rhythmic behavioral paradigm and functional magnetic resonance imaging, we identified networks of brain regions for perceptions of physically synchronous and asynchronous auditory-visual events. Measures of behavioral performance revealed the existence of three distinct perceptual states. Perception of asynchrony activated a network of the primary sensory, prefrontal, and inferior parietal cortices, perception of synchrony disengaged the inferior parietal cortex and further recruited the superior colliculus, and when no clear percept was established, only the residual areas comprised of prefrontal and sensory areas were active. These results indicate that distinct percepts arise within specific brain sub-networks, the components of which are differentially engaged and disengaged depending on the timing of environmental signals.},

@article{bart2005a,
	Abstract = {We present a rate model of the spontaneous activity in the auditory cortex, based on synaptic depression. A Stochastic integro-differential system of equations is derived and the analysis reveals two main regimes. The first regime corresponds to a normal activity. The second regime corresponds to epileptic spiking. A detailed analysis of each regime is presented and we prove in particular that synaptic depression stabilizes the global cortical dynamics. The transition between the two regimes is induced by a change in synaptic connectivity: when the overall connectivity is strong enough, an epileptic activity is spontaneously generated. Numerical simulations confirm the predictions of the theoretical analysis. In particular, our results explain the transition from normal to epileptic regime which can be induced in rats auditory cortex, following a specific pairing protocol. A change in the cortical maps reorganizes the synaptic connectivity and this transition between regimes is accounted for by our model. We have used data from recording experiments to fit synaptic weight distributions. Simulations with the fitted distributions are qualitatively similar to the real EEG recorded in vivo during the experiments. We conclude that changes in the synaptic weight function in our model, which affects excitatory synapses organization and reproduces the changes in cortical map connectivity can be understood as the main mechanism to explain the transitions of the EEG from the normal to the epileptic regime in the auditory cortex.},

@article{hupe2001b,
	Abstract = {We previously showed that feedback connections from MT play a role in figure/ground segmentation. Figure/ground coding has been described at the V1 level in the late part of the neuronal responses to visual stimuli, and it has been suggested that these late modulations depend on feedback connections. In the present work we tested whether it actually takes time for this information to be fed back to lower order areas. We analyzed the extracellular responses of 169 V1, V2, and V3 neurons that we recorded in two anesthetized macaque monkeys. MT was inactivated by cooling. We studied the time course of the responses of the neurons that were significantly affected by the inactivation of MT to see whether the effects were delayed relative to the onset of the response. We first measured the time course of the feedback influences from MT on V1, V2, and V3 neurons tested with moving stimuli. For the large majority of the 51 neurons for which the response decreased, the effect was present from the beginning of the response. In the responses averaged after normalization, the decrease of response was significant in the first 10-ms bin of response. A similar result was found for six neurons for which the response significantly increased when MT was inactivated. We then looked at the time course of the responses to flashed stimuli (95 neurons). We observed 15 significant decreases of response and 14 significant increases. In both populations, the effects were significant within the first 10 ms of response. For some neurons with increased responses we even observed a shorter latency when MT was inactivated. We measured the latency of the response to the flashed stimuli. We found that even the earliest responding neurons were affected early by the feedback from MT. This was true for the response to flashed and to moving stimuli. These results show that feedback connections are recruited very early for the treatment of visual information. It further indicates that the presence or absence of feedback effects cannot be deduced from the time course of the response modulations.},

	Abstract = {Background: In agreement with the systemic nature of Graves' disease, Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO) presents as a symmetric bilateral eye disease in the vast majority of patients. However, asymmetric involvement of both eyes is frequently observed. We hypothesized that sleeping position might be involved in asymmetric GO; when, for example, the preferred sleeping position is on the right side, retrobulbar pressure might be somewhat higher in the right than in the left orbit, resulting in more severe eye changes in the right eye. Methods: A prospective study in 75 consecutive untreated patients with GO, in whom eye changes and sleeping position were assessed independent of each other. Criteria for asymmetric eye changes were differences between both eyes in the presence of retrobulbar pain or of >/=1 grade in soft tissue involvement, and/or of >/=2 mm in exophthalmos, and/or >/=8 degrees in elevation. Preferred sleeping position was determined by questionnaire. Results: All patients had bilateral GO. Eye changes were symmetrical in 50 patients, and asymmetrical in 25 patients based on differences in proptosis and elevation. Sleeping position did not differ between symmetric and asymmetric GO. Preferred sleeping position was on the left side in 23%; on the right side in 31%; and on the back, on the belly, or unknown in 46%. In patients with asymmetric GO, the most affected ("worst") eye was not related to preferred sleeping position on the right or left side. Conclusion: Slight asymmetry of eye changes between both eyes in patients with bilateral GO is not related to preferred sleeping position on either the right or left side.},

	Abstract = {Neurogenesis occurs continuously in the forebrain of adult mammals, but the functional importance of adult neurogenesis is still unclear. Here, using a genetic labeling method in adult mice, we found that continuous neurogenesis results in the replacement of the majority of granule neurons in the olfactory bulb and a substantial addition of granule neurons to the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Genetic ablation of newly formed neurons in adult mice led to a gradual decrease in the number of granule cells in the olfactory bulb, inhibition of increases in the granule cell number in the dentate gyrus and impairment of behaviors in contextual and spatial memory, which are known to depend on hippocampus. These results suggest that continuous neurogenesis is required for the maintenance and reorganization of the whole interneuron system in the olfactory bulb, the modulation and refinement of the existing neuronal circuits in the dentate gyrus and the normal behaviors involved in hippocampal-dependent memory.},

	Abstract = {In V1, local circuitry depends on the position in the orientation map: close to pinwheel centers, recurrent inputs show variable orientation preferences; within iso-orientation domains, inputs are relatively uniformly tuned. Physiological properties such as cell's membrane potentials, spike outputs, and temporal characteristics change systematically with map location. We investigate in a firing rate and a Hodgkin-Huxley network model what constraints these tuning characteristics of V1 neurons impose on the cortical operating regime. Systematically varying the strength of both recurrent excitation and inhibition, we test a wide range of model classes and find the likely models to account for the experimental observations. We show that recent intracellular and extracellular recordings from cat V1 provide the strongest evidence for a regime where excitatory and inhibitory recurrent inputs are balanced and dominate the feed-forward input. Our results are robust against changes in model assumptions such as spatial extent and strength of lateral inhibition. Intriguingly, the most likely recurrent regime is in a region of parameter space where small changes have large effects on the network dynamics, and it is close to a regime of "runaway excitation," where the network shows strong self-sustained activity. This could make the cortical response particularly sensitive to modulation.},

	Abstract = {Electrophysiological recordings show that individual neurons in cortex are strongly activated when engaged in appropriate tasks, but they tell us little about how many neurons might be engaged by a task, which is important to know if we are to understand how cortex encodes information. For human cortex, I estimate the cost of individual spikes, then, from the known energy consumption of cortex, I establish how many neurons can be active concurrently. The cost of a single spike is high, and this severely limits, possibly to fewer than 1%, the number of neurons that can be substantially active concurrently. The high cost of spikes requires the brain not only to use representational codes that rely on very few active neurons, but also to allocate its energy resources flexibly among cortical regions according to task demand. The latter constraint explains the investment in local control of hemodynamics, exploited by functional magnetic resonance imaging, and the need for mechanisms of selective attention.},

	Abstract = {The emergence of memory, a trace of things past, into human consciousness is one of the greatest mysteries of the human mind. Whereas the neuronal basis of recognition memory can be probed experimentally in human and nonhuman primates, the study of free recall requires that the mind declare the occurrence of a recalled memory (an event intrinsic to the organism and invisible to an observer). Here, we report the activity of single neurons in the human hippocampus and surrounding areas when subjects first view television episodes consisting of audiovisual sequences and again later when they freely recall these episodes. A subset of these neurons exhibited selective firing, which often persisted throughout and following specific episodes for as long as 12 seconds. Verbal reports of memories of these specific episodes at the time of free recall were preceded by selective reactivation of the same hippocampal and entorhinal cortex neurons. We suggest that this reactivation is an internally generated neuronal correlate of the subjective experience of spontaneous emergence of human recollection.},

	Abstract = {Tuft dendrites are the main target for feedback inputs innervating neocortical layer 5 pyramidal neurons, but their properties remain obscure. We report the existence of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) spikes in the fine distal tuft dendrites that otherwise did not support the initiation of calcium spikes. Both direct measurements and computer simulations showed that NMDA spikes are the dominant mechanism by which distal synaptic input leads to firing of the neuron and provide the substrate for complex parallel processing of top-down input arriving at the tuft. These data lead to a new unifying view of integration in pyramidal neurons in which all fine dendrites, basal and tuft, integrate inputs locally through the recruitment of NMDA receptor channels relative to the fixed apical calcium and axosomatic sodium integration points.},

	Abstract = {The selectivity of cortical neurons remains invariant with contrast, even though the contrast-response function saturates. Both the invariance and the saturation might be due to a contrast-gain control mechanism. To test this hypothesis, a drifting grafting was used to measure the contrast-response function, while a counterphase grating was simultaneously presented at the null position of the receptive field (where it evokes no response at any contrast). When the contrast of the counterphase grating increased, the contrast-response function shifted primarily to the right. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that there is a fast-acting gain-control mechanism which effectively scales the input contrast by the average local contrast.},

	Abstract = {Irritation and negative valence are closely associated in perception. However, these perceptual aspects can be dissociated in olfaction where irritation can accompany both pleasant and unpleasant odorants. Whereas the sensation of odor reflects transduction at olfactory receptors, irritation reflects concurrent transduction of the odorant at trigeminal receptors. Thus a stimulus can be either a pure olfactant activating the olfactory receptors only or a bimodal odorant activating both types of receptors. Using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging and a 2 x 2 experimental design contrasting odorant valence (pleasant/unpleasant) and odorant type (pure olfactant/bimodal) we found activity in piriform cortex to be associated with valence, and not type, of odors. In contrast, activity in the olfactory tubercle was associated with type, and not valence, of odors. Importantly, this was found when perceived intensity was held equal across odorants. These findings suggest that dissociable neural substrates subserve the encoding of irritation and valence in olfaction.},

	Abstract = {Items that stand out from their surroundings, that is, those that attract attention, are considered to be salient. Salience is generated by input features in many stimulus dimensions, like motion (M), color (C), orientation (O), and others. We focus on bottom-up salience generated by contrast between the feature properties of an item and its surroundings. We compare the singleton search reaction times (RTs) of items that differ from their surroundings in more than one feature (e.g., C + O, denoted as CO) against the RTs of items that differ from their surroundings in only a single feature (e.g., O or C). The measured RTs for the double-feature singletons are compared against "race model" predictions to evaluate whether salience in the double-feature conditions is greater than the salience of either of its feature components. Affirmative answers were found in MO and CO but not in CM. These results are consistent with some V1 neurons being conjunctively selective to MO, others to CO, but almost none to CM. They provide support for the V1 hypothesis of bottom-up salience (Z. Li, 2002) but are contrary to expectation from the "feature summation" hypothesis, in which different stimulus features are initially analyzed independently and subsequently summed to form a single salience map (L. Itti {\&} C. Koch, 2001; C. Koch {\&} S. Ullman, 1985; J. M. Wolfe, K. R. Cave, {\&} S. L. Franzel, 1989).},

	Abstract = {Feature selection plays a crucial part for computer vision algorithms. By examining properties of fixation points in natural images collected via eyetracking, we take the human visual system as a model. Here we make use of intrinsic dimensionality (iD): Image patches with high i0D values correspond to homogeneous surfaces, whereas patches with high i1D values contain edges, lines or parallel lines. A high i2D value corresponds to corners, junctions, and the like. A comparison of mean iD feature values at actual fixations points with those at control points shows significant effects: Mean i0D values are lower for actual than for control, while mean i1D and i2D values are higher. A subsequent information-theoretic analysis shows entropy to be higher at actual than at control points. Mutual information between successive fixation points is found to be significantly lower for actual than control sequences. This effect stems mainly from short saccades, as is revealed by calculation of mutual information from saccades falling into different length ranges. As it turns out, the human visual system prefers scarce features like corners or junctions over common ones like homogeneous surfaces. iD provides an effective computational means to extract and classify such features.},

	Abstract = {Neurons in cortical area V4 respond selectively to complex visual patterns such as curved contours and non-Cartesian gratings. Most previous experiments in V4 have measured responses to small, idiosyncratic stimulus sets and no single functional model yet accounts for all of the disparate results. We propose that one model, the spectral receptive field (SRF), can explain many observations of selectivity in V4. The SRF describes tuning in terms of the orientation and spatial frequency spectrum and can, in principle, predict the response to any visual stimulus. We estimated SRFs for neurons in V4 of awake primates by linearized reverse correlation of responses to a large set of natural images. We find that V4 neurons have large orientation and spatial frequency bandwidth and often bimodal orientation tuning. For comparison, we estimated SRFs for neurons in primary visual cortex (V1). Consistent with previous observations, we find that V1 neurons have narrower bandwidth than that of V4. To determine whether estimated SRFs can account for previous observations of selectivity, we used them to predict responses to Cartesian gratings, non-Cartesian gratings, natural images, and curved contours. Based on these predictions, we find that the majority of neurons in V1 are selective for Cartesian gratings, whereas the majority of V4 neurons are selective for non-Cartesian gratings or natural images. The SRF describes visual tuning properties with a second-order nonlinear model. These results support the hypothesis that a second-order model is sufficient to describe the general mechanisms mediating shape selectivity in area V4.},

	Abstract = {Viewed in the plane of the cortical surface, the visual cortex is composed of overlapping functional maps that represent stimulus features such as edge orientation, direction of motion, and spatial frequency. Spatial relationships between these maps are thought to ensure that all combinations of stimulus features are represented uniformly across the visual field. Implicit in this view is the assumption that feature combinations are represented in the form of a place code such that a given pattern of activity uniquely signifies a specific combination of stimulus features. Here we review results of experiments that challenge the place code model for the representation of feature combinations. Rather than overlapping maps of stimulus features, we suggest that patterns of activity evoked by complex stimuli are best understood in the context of a single map of spatiotemporal energy.},

	Abstract = {Saliency map models account for a small but significant amount of the variance in where people fixate, but evaluating these models with natural stimuli has led to mixed results. In the present study, the eye movements of participants were recorded while they viewed color photographs of natural scenes in preparation for a memory test (encoding) and when recognizing them later. These eye movements were then compared to the predictions of a well defined saliency map model (L. Itti {\&} C. Koch, 2000), in terms of both individual fixation locations and fixation sequences (scanpaths). The saliency model is a significantly better predictor of fixation location than random models that take into account bias toward central fixations, and this is the case at both encoding and recognition. However, similarity between scanpaths made at multiple viewings of the same stimulus suggests that repetitive scanpaths also contribute to where people look. Top-down recapitulation of scanpaths is a key prediction of scanpath theory (D. Noton {\&} L. Stark, 1971), but it might also be explained by bottom-up guidance. The present data suggest that saliency cannot account for scanpaths and that incorporating these sequences could improve model predictions.},

	Abstract = {We can claim that we know what the visual system does once we can predict neural responses to arbitrary stimuli, including those seen in nature. In the early visual system, models based on one or more linear receptive fields hold promise to achieve this goal as long as the models include nonlinear mechanisms that control responsiveness, based on stimulus context and history, and take into account the nonlinearity of spike generation. These linear and nonlinear mechanisms might be the only essential determinants of the response, or alternatively, there may be additional fundamental determinants yet to be identified. Research is progressing with the goals of defining a single "standard model" for each stage of the visual pathway and testing the predictive power of these models on the responses to movies of natural scenes. These predictive models represent, at a given stage of the visual pathway, a compact description of visual computation. They would be an invaluable guide for understanding the underlying biophysical and anatomical mechanisms and relating neural responses to visual perception.},

	Abstract = {Spontaneous cortical activity of single neurons is often either dismissed as noise, or is regarded as carrying no functional significance and hence is ignored. Our findings suggest that such concepts should be revised. We explored the coherent population activity of neuronal assemblies in primary sensory area in the absence of a sensory input. Recent advances in real-time optical imaging based on voltage-sensitive dyes (VSDI) have facilitated exploration of population activity and its intimate relationship to the activity of individual cortical neurons. It has been shown by in vivo intracellular recordings that the dye signal measures the sum of the membrane potential changes in all the neuronal elements in the imaged area, emphasizing subthreshold synaptic potentials and dendritic action potentials in neuronal arborizations originating from neurons in all cortical layers whose dendrites reach the superficial cortical layers. Thus, the VSDI has allowed us to image the rather illusive activity in neuronal dendrites that cannot be readily explored by single unit recordings. Surprisingly, we found that the amplitude of this type of ongoing subthreshold activity is of the same order of magnitude as evoked activity. We also found that this ongoing activity exhibited high synchronization over many millimeters of cortex. We then investigated the influence of ongoing activity on the evoked response, and showed that the two interact strongly. Furthermore, we found that cortical states that were previously associated only with evoked activity can actually be observed also in the absence of stimulation, for example, the cortical representation of a given orientation may appear without any visual input. This demonstration suggests that ongoing activity may also play a major role in other cortical function by providing a neuronal substrate for the dependence of sensory information processing on context, behavior, memory and other aspects of cognitive function.},

	Abstract = {Humans regularly produce new utterances that are understood by other members of the same language community. Linguistic theories account for this ability through the use of syntactic rules (or generative grammars) that describe the acceptable structure of utterances. The recursive, hierarchical embedding of language units (for example, words or phrases within shorter sentences) that is part of the ability to construct new utterances minimally requires a 'context-free' grammar that is more complex than the 'finite-state' grammars thought sufficient to specify the structure of all non-human communication signals. Recent hypotheses make the central claim that the capacity for syntactic recursion forms the computational core of a uniquely human language faculty. Here we show that European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) accurately recognize acoustic patterns defined by a recursive, self-embedding, context-free grammar. They are also able to classify new patterns defined by the grammar and reliably exclude agrammatical patterns. Thus, the capacity to classify sequences from recursive, centre-embedded grammars is not uniquely human. This finding opens a new range of complex syntactic processing mechanisms to physiological investigation.},

	Abstract = {The aim of this study was (1) to provide behavioral evidence for multimodal feature integration in an object recognition task in humans and (2) to characterize the processing stages and the neural structures where multisensory interactions take place. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded from 30 scalp electrodes while subjects performed a forced-choice reaction-time categorization task: At each trial, the subjects had to indicate which of two objects was presented by pressing one of two keys. The two objects were defined by auditory features alone, visual features alone, or the combination of auditory and visual features. Subjects were more accurate and rapid at identifying multimodal than unimodal objects. Spatiotemporal analysis of ERPs and scalp current densities revealed several auditory-visual interaction components temporally, spatially, and functionally distinct before 200 msec poststimulus. The effects observed were (1) in visual areas, new neural activities (as early as 40 msec poststimulus) and modulation (amplitude decrease) of the N185 wave to unimodal visual stimulus, (2) in the auditory cortex, modulation (amplitude increase) of subcomponents of the unimodal auditory N1 wave around 90 to 110 msec, and (3) new neural activity over the right fronto-temporal area (140 to 165 msec). Furthermore, when the subjects were separated into two groups according to their dominant modality to perform the task in unimodal conditions (shortest reaction time criteria), the integration effects were found to be similar for the two groups over the nonspecific fronto-temporal areas, but they clearly differed in the sensory-specific cortices, affecting predominantly the sensory areas of the nondominant modality. Taken together, the results indicate that multisensory integration is mediated by flexible, highly adaptive physiological processes that can take place very early in the sensory processing chain and operate in both sensory-specific and nonspecific cortical structures in different ways.},

	Abstract = {Immediately following an event at a peripheral location there is facilitation for the processing of other stimuli near that location. This is said to reflect a reflexive shift of attention towards the source of stimulation. After attention is removed from such a peripheral location, there is then delayed responding to stimuli subsequently displayed there. This inhibitory aftereffect, first described in 1984 and later labeled 'inhibition of return (IOR)', encourages orienting towards novel locations and hence might facilitate foraging and other search behaviors. Since its relatively recent discovery, IOR has been the subject of intensive investigation, from many angles and with a wide variety of approaches. After describing the seminal contribution of Posner and Cohen ('Who'), this review will discuss what causes IOR and, once initiated, what effects IOR has on subsequent processing ('What'). The time course ('When') and spatial distribution ('Where') of IOR, and what is known about IOR's neural implementation ('How') and functional significance ('Why') are also discussed.},

	Abstract = {We studied the influences of competing visual and auditory stimuli on horizontal gaze shifts in humans. Gaze shifts were made to visual or auditory targets in the presence of either an irrelevant visual or auditory cue. Within an experiment, the target and irrelevant cue were either aligned (enhancer condition) or misaligned (distractor condition) in space. The times of presentation of the target and irrelevant cue were varied so that the target could have been presented before the irrelevant cue, or the irrelevant cue before the target. We compared subject performance in the enhancer and distractor conditions, measuring reaction latencies and the frequency of incorrect gaze shifts. Performance differed the most when the irrelevant cue was presented before the target and differed the least when the target was presented before the irrelevant cue. Our results reveal that, in addition to the spatial and temporal register of the stimuli, the experimental context in which the stimuli are presented also influences multisensory integration: an irrelevant auditory cue influenced gaze shifts to visual targets differently than an irrelevant visual cue influenced gaze shifts to auditory targets. Furthermore, we observed patterns of influence unique to either visual or auditory irrelevant cues that occurred regardless of the modality of the target. We believe that subjects adopted a state of motor readiness that reflected the unique demands of target selection in each experiment and that this state modulated the influences of the irrelevant cue on the target.},

	Abstract = {A fundamental function of the visual system is to encode the building blocks of natural scenes-edges, textures and shapes-that subserve visual tasks such as object recognition and scene understanding. Essential to this process is the formation of abstract representations that generalize from specific instances of visual input. A common view holds that neurons in the early visual system signal conjunctions of image features, but how these produce invariant representations is poorly understood. Here we propose that to generalize over similar images, higher-level visual neurons encode statistical variations that characterize local image regions. We present a model in which neural activity encodes the probability distribution most consistent with a given image. Trained on natural images, the model generalizes by learning a compact set of dictionary elements for image distributions typically encountered in natural scenes. Model neurons show a diverse range of properties observed in cortical cells. These results provide a new functional explanation for nonlinear effects in complex cells and offer insight into coding strategies in primary visual cortex (V1) and higher visual areas.},

We investigated how nonpigment floral chemistry influences nectar removal, floral visitation, florivory, rates of outcrossing, and fitness through both male and female functions. We blocked expression of biosynthetic genes of the dominant floral attractant [benzyl acetone (Nachal1)] and nectar repellent [nicotine (Napmt1/2)] in all combinations in the native tobacco Nicotiana attenuata and measured their effects on plants in their native habitat. Both repellent and attractant were required to maximize capsule production and seed siring in emasculated flowers and flower visitation by native pollinators, whereas nicotine reduced florivory and nectar robbing.},

@article{david2004a,
	Abstract = {Studies of the primary visual cortex (V1) have produced models that account for neuronal responses to synthetic stimuli such as sinusoidal gratings. Little is known about how these models generalize to activity during natural vision. We recorded neural responses in area V1 of awake macaques to a stimulus with natural spatiotemporal statistics and to a dynamic grating sequence stimulus. We fit nonlinear receptive field models using each of these data sets and compared how well they predicted time-varying responses to a novel natural visual stimulus. On average, the model fit using the natural stimulus predicted natural visual responses more than twice as accurately as the model fit to the synthetic stimulus. The natural vision model produced better predictions in >75% of the neurons studied. This large difference in predictive power suggests that natural spatiotemporal stimulus statistics activate nonlinear response properties in a different manner than the grating stimulus. To characterize this modulation, we compared the temporal and spatial response properties of the model fits. During natural stimulation, temporal responses often showed a stronger late inhibitory component, indicating an effect of nonlinear temporal summation during natural vision. In addition, spatial tuning underwent complex shifts, primarily in the inhibitory, rather than excitatory, elements of the response profile. These differences in late and spatially tuned inhibition accounted fully for the difference in predictive power between the two models. Both the spatial and temporal statistics of the natural stimulus contributed to the modulatory effects.},

	Abstract = {We examined the spatial distribution of population activity in primary visual cortex (V1) of tree shrews with optical imaging and electrophysiology. A line stimulus, thinner than the average V1 receptive field, evoked a broad strip of neural activity of nearly constant size for all stimulus locations tested within the central 10 degrees of visual space. Stimuli in adjacent positions activated highly overlapping populations of neurons; nevertheless, small changes in stimulus position produced orderly changes in the location of the peak of the population response. Statistically significant shifts in the population response were found for stimulus displacements an order of magnitude smaller than receptive field width, down to the limit of optical imaging resolution. Based on the pattern of population activity, we conclude that the map of visual space in V1 is orderly at a fine scale and has uniform coverage of position and orientation without local relationships in the mapping of these features.},

	Abstract = {How do we decide where to look next? During natural, active vision, we move our eyes to gather task-relevant information from the visual scene. Information theory provides an elegant framework for investigating how visual stimulus information combines with prior knowledge and task goals to plan an eye movement. We measured eye movements as observers performed a shape-learning and -matching task, for which the task-relevant information was tightly controlled. Using computational models, we probe the underlying strategies used by observers when planning their next eye movement. One strategy is to move the eyes to locations that maximize the total information gained about the shape, which is equivalent to reducing global uncertainty. Observers' behavior may appear highly similar to this strategy, but a rigorous analysis of sequential fixation placement reveals that observers may instead be using a local rule: fixate only the most informative locations, that is, reduce local uncertainty.},

	Abstract = {While evidence indicates that neural systems may be employing sparse approximations to represent sensed stimuli, the mechanisms underlying this ability are not understood. We describe a locally competitive algorithm (LCA) that solves a collection of sparse coding principles minimizing a weighted combination of mean-squared error and a coefficient cost function. LCAs are designed to be implemented in a dynamical system composed of many neuron-like elements operating in parallel. These algorithms use thresholding functions to induce local (usually one-way) inhibitory competitions between nodes to produce sparse representations. LCAs produce coefficients with sparsity levels comparable to the most popular centralized sparse coding algorithms while being readily suited for neural implementation. Additionally, LCA coefficients for video sequences demonstrate inertial properties that are both qualitatively and quantitatively more regular (i.e., smoother and more predictable) than the coefficients produced by greedy algorithms.},

	Abstract = {Neuronal interactions between primary and secondary visual cortical areas are important for visual processing, but the spatiotemporal patterns of the interaction are not well understood. We used voltage-sensitive dye imaging to visualize neuronal activity in rat visual cortex and found visually evoked waves propagating from V1 to other visual areas. A primary wave originated in the monocular area of V1 and was "compressed" when propagating to V2. A reflected wave initiated after compression and propagated backward into V1. The compression occurred at the V1/V2 border, and local GABAA inhibition is important for the compression. The compression/reflection pattern provides a two-phase modulation: V1 is first depolarized by the primary wave, and then V1 and V2 are simultaneously depolarized by the reflected and primary waves, respectively. The compression/reflection pattern only occurred for evoked waves and not for spontaneous waves, suggesting that it is organized by an internal mechanism associated with visual processing.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: Fixation durations are normally adapted to the difficulty of the foveal analysis task. We examine to what extent artificial central and peripheral visual field defects interfere with this adaptation process. METHODS: Subjects performed a visual search task while their eye movements were registered. The latter were used to drive a real-time gaze-dependent display that was used to create artificial central and peripheral visual field defects. Recorded eye movements were used to determine saccadic amplitude, number of fixations, fixation durations, return saccades, and changes in saccade direction. RESULTS: For central defects, although fixation duration increased with the size of the absolute central scotoma, this increase was too small to keep recognition performance optimal, evident from an associated increase in the rate of return saccades. Providing a relatively small amount of visual information in the central scotoma did substantially reduce subjects' search times but not their fixation durations. Surprisingly, reducing the size of the tunnel also prolonged fixation duration for peripheral defects. This manipulation also decreased the rate of return saccades, suggesting that the fixations were prolonged beyond the duration required by the foveal task. CONCLUSIONS: Although we find that adaptation of fixation duration to task difficulty clearly occurs in the presence of artificial scotomas, we also find that such field defects may render the adaptation suboptimal for the task at hand. Thus, visual field defects may not only hinder vision by limiting what the subject sees of the environment but also by limiting the visual system's ability to program efficient eye movements. We speculate this is because of how visual field defects bias the balance between saccade generation and fixation stabilization.},

When both locations were within the receptive field of a cell in prestriate area V4 or the inferior temporal cortex, the response to the unattended stimulus was dramatically reduced. Cells in the striate cortex were unaffected by attention. The filtering of irrelevant information from the receptive fields of extrastriate neurons may underlie the ability to identify and remember the properties of a particular object out of the many that may be represented on the retina.},

	Abstract = {The subjective visual space perceived by humans does not reflect a simple transformation of objective physical space; rather, perceived space has an idiosyncratic relationship with the real world. To date, there is no consensus about either the genesis of perceived visual space or the implications of its peculiar characteristics for visually guided behavior. Here we used laser range scanning to measure the actual distances from the image plane of all unoccluded points in a series of natural scenes. We then asked whether the differences between real and apparent distances could be explained by the statistical relationship of scene geometry and the observer. We were able to predict perceived distances in a variety of circumstances from the probability distribution of physical distances. This finding lends support to the idea that the characteristics of human visual space are determined probabilistically.},

	Abstract = {There exist a large number of visual illusions indicating that perception differs from pure representation of physical input. For example, a spot of light can be characterized by its position, but it does not contribute any information about orientation. However, when moved fast enough, a continuous streak along its trajectory is perceived that helps to determine the orientation of the movement path. The question arises whether the processing of the trajectory and its orientation are simultaneously represented in the primary visual cortex. Here I show that decoding neural population activity within a two-dimensional parameter space represents both (1) physical input given by the actual position of the moving spot and (2) orientation. This latter parameter has no physical counterpart in the stimulus but must be actively formed by spatiotemporal integration of the spot's trajectory.},

	Abstract = {Most models of visual search are based on the intuition that humans choose fixation locations containing features that best match the features of the target. The optimal version of this feature-based strategy is what we term "maximum a posteriori (MAP) search." Alternatively, humans could choose fixations that maximize information gained about the target's location. We term this information-based strategy "ideal search." Here we compare eye movements of human, MAP, and ideal searchers in tasks where known targets are embedded at unknown locations within random backgrounds having the spectral characteristics of natural scenes. We find that both human and ideal searchers preferentially fixate locations in a donut-shaped region around the center of the circular search area, with a high density of fixations at top and bottom, while MAP searchers distribute their fixations more uniformly, with low density at top and bottom. Our results argue for a sophisticated search mechanism that maximizes the information collected across fixations.},

	Abstract = {The local field potential (LFP) is a population measure of neuronal activity complementary to spike trains. Whereas the response properties of the spiking activity in the visual cortex have been characterized extensively, the responses of the LFP have not been well explored. No coherent picture exists about which frequency ranges exhibit feature tuning or show stimulus locked activity. Addressing this, we recorded LFP in the primary visual cortex of alert cats and calculated the tuning indices for orientation, spatial and temporal frequency. Furthermore, we quantified the locking of the power in different LFP frequency bands to the velocity profile of artificial and natural stimuli. We found that the LFP in alert animals is well tuned with similar specificity to orientation, spatial frequency and temporal frequency. Tuning to these features is most prominent in two frequency bands (8-23 Hz and 39-109 Hz). In two complementary frequency bands (23-39 Hz and above 109 Hz) the dynamics of the LFP power is locked tightly to the temporal structure of the stimulus. This locking is furthermore independent of the spatial structure of the stimulus. Together these four frequency bands cover the whole frequency range investigated. In contrast to previous studies, which often reported correlates of visual processing only in a limited frequency range of the LFP, the present results suggest that the entire frequency range of the LFP can be assigned a role in visual processing.},

	Abstract = {Natural sounds, especially communication sounds, have highly structured amplitude and phase spectra. We have quantified how structure in the amplitude spectrum of natural sounds affects coding in primary auditory afferents. Auditory afferents encode stimuli with naturalistic amplitude spectra dramatically better than broad-band stimuli (approximating white noise); the rate at which the spike train carries information about the stimulus is 2-6 times higher for naturalistic sounds. Furthermore, the information rates can reach 90% of the fundamental limit to information transmission set by the statistics of the spike response. These results indicate that the coding strategy of the auditory nerve is matched to the structure of natural sounds; this 'tuning' allows afferent spike trains to provide higher processing centres with a more complete description of the sensory world.},

	Abstract = {The map of orientation columns in primary visual cortex (V1) is known to show strong local distortions, with a generally smooth progression of orientation preference across extended regions of cortex, interrupted by sharp jumps (fractures) and point singularities. The map of visual space on V1, in contrast, has been assumed to be locally smooth and isotropic. We find, on the contrary, that the map of visual space on cat V1 shows strong and systematic local distortions in register with inhomogeneities in the orientation map, with the rate of receptive field movement across cortex being largely proportional to the local rate of change of orientation. This suggests possible systematic local variations in the functional connectivity of short-range lateral connections that underlie local cortical processing.},

@article{rossi2001a,
	Abstract = {Recent studies have suggested that V1 neurons extract figures from their backgrounds, in that they respond better to interior features of figures than to equivalent features of background stimuli. This is reportedly true even when the figure boundaries are distant from the borders of the classical receptive field (RF). To test the role of V1 neurons in figure-ground segregation, we recorded their responses to texture figures on texture backgrounds, centered on the RF. The texture elements of the figures remained identical across trials, and figure boundaries were defined by orientation differences between the elements in the background texture relative to elements in the figure. For nearly all neurons (98/102), responses to a large texture figure did not differ from the responses to a uniform-texture background. Although many neurons gave enhanced responses to texture boundaries, this occurred only when the boundaries were within or close to the RF borders. Similar effects were found in V2. For neurons in V1, the limited spatial extent of the contextual modulation was not increased either at low stimulus contrast or when the animal was rewarded for detecting an orientation-defined figure. Thus, V1 neurons appear to signal texture boundaries rather than figures per se. Unexpectedly, many V1 neurons gave significant long-latency responses to texture stimuli located entirely outside the classical RF, up to 5 degrees from the RF border in some cases. However, these responses did not depend on the stimulus forming a figure that contained the RF. Although V1 neurons are influenced by stimuli outside the classical RF, they do not appear to segregate figures from ground.},

	Abstract = {The visual system is continually inundated with information received by the eyes. Only a fraction of this information appears to reach visual awareness. This process of selection is one of the functions ascribed to visual attention. Although many studies have investigated the role of attention in shaping neuronal representations in cortical areas, few have focused on attentional modulation of neuronal signals related to visual motion. We recorded from 89 direction-selective neurons in middle temporal (MT) and medial superior temporal (MST) visual cortical areas of two macaque monkeys using identical sensory stimulation under various attentional conditions. Neural responses in both areas were greatly influenced by attention. When attention was directed to a stimulus inside the receptive field of a neuron, responses in MT and MST were enhanced an average of 20 and 40% compared with a condition in which attention was directed outside the receptive field. Even stronger average enhancements (70% in MT and 100% in MST) were observed when attention was switched from a stimulus moving in the nonpreferred direction inside the receptive field to another stimulus in the receptive field that was moving in the preferred direction. These findings show that attention modulates motion processing from stages early in the dorsal visual pathway by selectively enhancing the representation of attended stimuli and simultaneously reducing the influence of unattended stimuli.},

	Abstract = {We have investigated the organization of regions outside the classical receptive field (CRF) for neurons in the visual cortex. First, we have determined the incidence and nature of interactions from outside the CRF. We find interaction from regions outside the CRF for a majority of cortical cells and it is almost always of a suppressive nature. Second, we have determined that most interaction is from specific well-defined regions outside the CRF. These regions are generally as effective as what is found for a complete annulus. Third, it is possible to reverse the inhibition from outside the CRF by the addition of a second grating that is orthogonal to the preferred orientation. This disinhibition may completely offset the suppressive influence of the surround. Additional experiments suggest that this process is not necessarily involved in figure/ground analysis.},

@article{borg-graham1998a,
	Abstract = {The function and nature of inhibition of neurons in the visual cortex have been the focus of both experimental and theoretical investigations. There are two ways in which inhibition can suppress synaptic excitation. In hyperpolarizing inhibition, negative and positive currents sum linearly to produce a net change in membrane potential. In contrast, shunting inhibition acts nonlinearly by causing an increase in membrane conductance; this divides the amplitude of the excitatory response. Visually evoked changes in membrane conductance have been reported to be nonsignificant or weak, supporting the hyperpolarization mode of inhibition. Here we present a new approach to studying inhibition that is based on in vivo whole-cell voltage clamping. This technique allows the continuous measurement of conductance dynamics during visual activation. We show, in neurons of cat primary visual cortex, that the response to optimally orientated flashed bars can increase the somatic input conductance to more than three times that of the resting state. The short latency of the visually evoked peak of conductance, and its apparent reversal potential suggest a dominant contribution from gamma-aminobutyric acid ((GABA)A) receptor-mediated synapses. We propose that nonlinear shunting inhibition may act during the initial stage of visual cortical processing, setting the balance between opponent 'On' and 'Off' responses in different locations of the visual receptive field.},

	Abstract = {The relative efficiency of any particular image-coding scheme should be defined only in relation to the class of images that the code is likely to encounter. To understand the representation of images by the mammalian visual system, it might therefore be useful to consider the statistics of images from the natural environment (i.e., images with trees, rocks, bushes, etc). In this study, various coding schemes are compared in relation to how they represent the information in such natural images. The coefficients of such codes are represented by arrays of mechanisms that respond to local regions of space, spatial frequency, and orientation (Gabor-like transforms). For many classes of image, such codes will not be an efficient means of representing information. However, the results obtained with six natural images suggest that the orientation and the spatial-frequency tuning of mammalian simple cells are well suited for coding the information in such images if the goal of the code is to convert higher-order redundancy (e.g., correlation between the intensities of neighboring pixels) into first-order redundancy (i.e., the response distribution of the coefficients). Such coding produces a relatively high signal-to-noise ratio and permits information to be transmitted with only a subset of the total number of cells. These results support Barlow's theory that the goal of natural vision is to represent the information in the natural environment with minimal redundancy.},

To determine how spatiotemporal dynamics of microstimulation-evoked activity are converted into saccade plans, we used a combination of real-time optical imaging and microstimulation in behaving monkeys. Short stimulation trains evoked a rapid and widespread wave of depolarization followed by unexpected large and prolonged hyperpolarization. During this hyperpolarization saccades are almost exclusively ipsilateral, suggesting an important role for hyperpolarization in determining saccade goal.},

	Abstract = {In contrast with previous knowledge based on extracellular recordings, the recent development of intracellular techniques in vivo (sharp electrode or 'blind patch') ideally allows experimenters to analyze and dissect the contribution of feedforward and lateral connectivity in the functional expression of a synaptic 'integration field'. We will present recent data which demonstrate that the visual receptive field of cortical neurons described at the level of subthreshold synaptic events extends over much larger regions of the visual field than previously thought, and that the capacity of cells to amplify subthreshold responses depends on the immediate past history of their membrane potential. Our data suggest that visual cortical receptive fields should not be considered as a fixed entity but more as a dynamic field of integration and association. Two types of dynamics can be argued for: 1) the spatial structure of the minimal discharge field (defined by suprathreshold activation of the cell) can be profoundly reorganized at least during development and most probably during selective phases of learning under the control of activity-dependent mechanisms. Adaptive changes in visual responses are thought to reflect long-lasting potentiation and/or depression of synaptic efficacies conveying ON- and OFF-center information; and 2) during sensory processing, reconfiguration of synaptic weights may be achieved on a much faster time-scale and linked to nor-linear properties of the postsynaptic membrane as well as that of recruited networks. Association of information available in the central part of the receptive field (RF) and of input coming from the reputedly 'unresponsive' regions surrounding it, or arising simultaneously from different parts of the visual field, might be suppressive in certain cases and capable of boosting hidden responses in other cases, depending on the global stimulus configuration.},

	Abstract = {Perception and cortical responses are not only driven "bottom-up" by the external stimulus but are altered by internal constraints such as expectancy or the current behavioral goal. To investigate neurophysiological mechanisms of such top-down effects, we analyzed the temporal interactions of neurons on different levels of the cortical hierarchy during perception of stimuli with varying behavioral significance. We found that interareal interactions in a middle-frequency range (theta and alpha; 4-12 Hz) strongly depend on the associated behavior, with a phase relationship and a layer specificity indicating a top-down-directed interaction. For novel unexpected stimuli, presumably processed in a feed-forward fashion, no such interactions occurred but high-frequency interactions (gamma; 20-100 Hz) were observed. Thus corticocortical synchronization reflects the internal state of the animal and may mediate top-down processes.},

	Abstract = {Temporal proximity is a critical determinant for cross-modal integration by multisensory neurons. Information content may serve as an additional binding factor for more complex or less natural multisensory information. Letters and speech sounds, which form the basis of literacy acquisition, are not naturally related but associated through explicit learning. We investigated the relative importance of temporal proximity and information content on the integration of letters and speech sounds by manipulating both factors within the same functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) design. The results reveal significant interactions between temporal proximity and content congruency in anterior and posterior auditory association cortex, indicating that temporal synchrony is critical for the integration of letters and speech sounds. The temporal profiles for multisensory integration in the auditory association cortex resemble those demonstrated for single multisensory neurons in different brain structures and animal species. This similarity suggests that basic neural integration rules apply to the binding of multisensory information that is not naturally related but overlearned during literacy acquisition. Furthermore, the present study shows the suitability of fMRI to study temporal aspects of multisensory neural processing.},

	Abstract = {The antisaccade task requires participants to inhibit the reflexive tendency to look at a sudden onset target and instead direct their gaze to the opposite hemifield. As such it provides a convenient tool with which to investigate the cognitive and neural systems that support goal-directed behaviour. Recent models of cognitive control suggest that antisaccade performance on a single trial should vary as a function of the outcome (correct antisaccade or erroneous prosaccade) of the previous trial. In addition, repetition priming effects suggest that the spatial location of the target on the previous trial may also influence current trial performance. Thus an analysis of contingency effects in antisaccade performance may provide new insights into the factors that influence the monitoring and modulation of the antisaccade task and other ongoing behaviours. Using a multilevel modelling analysis we explored previous trial effects on current trial performance in a large antisaccade dataset. We found (1) repetition priming effects following correct antisaccades; (2) contrary to models of cognitive control antisaccade error rates were increased on trials following an error, suggesting that failures to adequately maintain the task goal can persist across more than one trial; and (3) current trial latencies varied according to the previous trial outcome (correct antisaccade, slowly corrected error or rapidly corrected error). These results are discussed in terms of current models of antisaccade performance and cognitive control and further demonstrate the utility of multilevel modelling for analysing antisaccade data.},

	Abstract = {Attending to a location in space significantly improves stimulus perception at that location. Everyday experience requires the deployment of attention to multiple objects at different locations. Recent empirical evidence suggests that the "beam" of attention can be divided between non-contiguous areas of the visual field. Whether this is only possible when stimuli are presented in different hemifields and harder, if not impossible, when stimuli are in the same hemifield is an ongoing debate. Here we use an electrophysiological measure of sustained attentional resource allocation (the steady-state visual evoked potential, SSVEP) to address this question. In combination with behavioural data we demonstrate that splitting the attentional "beam" is in principle possible within one hemifield. However, results showed that task performance was in general lower for same-hemifield presentation as opposed to our previous study with different-hemifield presentation [M.M. Muller, P. Malinowski, T. Gruber, S.A. Hillyard, Sustained division of the attentional spotlight, Nature 424 (2003) 309-312]. SSVEP amplitude showed a mixed pattern of results for stimuli presented in the upper versus lower quadrant of the left visual hemifield under conditions of attending to two separated locations. Results are discussed in the light of the bilateral distribution advantage hypothesis and differences in stimulus salience between the upper and lower visual field.},

@article{schein1990a,
	Abstract = {Spectral properties of 129 cells in the V4 area of 5 macaque monkeys were studied quantitatively with narrow-band and broad-band colored lights. The large majority of cells exhibited some degree of wavelength sensitivity within their receptive fields. The half-bandwidth of the primary peak in the spectral-response curve was less than 50 nm for 72% of the cells; the mean half-bandwidth of these cells, 27 nm, is similar to that found for color-opponent ganglion cells and cells in the parvocellular dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN). Contrast-response functions indicated that the narrow spectral tuning of these cells derived from cone opponent interactions. From comparison of receptive-field sizes, we suggest that a typical V4 neuron sums inputs that ultimately derive from several thousand ganglion or parvocellular dLGN cells. In spite of their wavelength sensitivity, most V4 cells had properties that would not fit some simple criteria for classification as "color selective." First, few cells showed overt signs of color opponency, namely, on-inhibition or off-excitation to spectrally opponent wavelengths. Second, about 30% of the cells in V4 had spectral-response curves with 2 peaks. (The wavelength distribution of these second peaks was almost identical to that of primary peaks, and combinations of peak wavelengths were fairly random.) Third, most cells responded to white light; overall, the response to white light was about 60% of that to the best narrow-band or broad-band colored light. Similarly, most V4 cells gave at least a small response to all or nearly all of the different broad-band colored lights we presented. Therefore, a given V4 cell is very likely to respond to most of the colored or white surfaces in natural scenes. These combinations of response properties probably explain the widely divergent percentages of "color" cells reported in previous studies of V4. The most unusual spectral property we found in V4 was a large, spectrally sensitive surround outside the "classical receptive field" of most cells. Although stimulation of the surround by itself did not cause any response, surround stimulation could completely suppress the response to even the optimally colored stimulus in the receptive field. In general, the optimal wavelengths for receptive-field excitation and surround suppression were the same or nearly so. Thus, "color contrast" may be computed in V4. In some cases, contrasting wavelengths in the surround caused moderate enhancement of response to a receptive-field stimulus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	Abstract = {We studied the encoding of stimulus orientation in the visual cortex of alert animals using information theory methods. Based on a labeled-line code, the encoding of orientation was mostly synergistic and only few pairs coded redundant. The synergy contributed about 20% of the information and was strongest for sites with distinct tuning curves. A recently proposed decomposition of synergy revealed that redundancy introduced by common tuning preferences is more than just compensated by noise correlations which mostly contributed synergistically. Based on a pooled response code, the contribution of noise correlations diminished resulting in a severe information loss. Thus, to operate economically, cortical neurons should either employ a labeled-line code or, if using pooled responses, be highly selective in choosing afferents.},

	Abstract = {1. Responses of cat retinal ganglion cells have been examined with a view to specifying the characteristics that limit the detection of light stimuli.2. Threshold is defined as the weakest stimulus that can be reliably detected by examination of the output from a retinal ganglion cell; it depends upon (a) the quantum/spike ratio, which is the mean number of additional quantal absorptions required to produce an additional impulse, (b) the temporal course of the response, which determines the time interval within which the maintained discharge is modified, and (c) the statistical distribution of the number of impulses that occur in this time interval in the absence of the stimulus.3. The quantum/spike ratio changes greatly when adapting luminance is changed, and this is the predominant factor accounting for changes in increment threshold.4. The time course of the response changes with adaptation level and area of the stimulus. This may account for the changes in temporal integration that occur in analogous psychophysical experiments.5. Changes in the irregularity of the maintained discharge also affect the threshold of single ganglion cells. This is only a minor factor in the conditions of most of our experiments, but it may be important when unstabilized images and non-equilibrium adaptation conditions are encountered.},

	Abstract = {The extent of thyroidectomy in Graves' disease is still controversial. In our institution, long term euthyroidism without thyroxine replacement therapy has been aimed and, thus, subtotal thyroidectomy has been employed. We prospectively studied whether the surgical outcome was improved by a strategy of leaving smaller thyroid remnants. Between 1989 and 1998, 1897 patients with Graves' disease were treated by subtotal thyroidectomy and their thyroid function could be determined 2 to 3 years after thyroidectomy. The 10-year period was divided into 3 parts, '89-'91 (Period 1, n = 690), '92-'94 (Period 2, n = 587) and '95-'98 (Period 3, n = 620). Different maximum thyroid remnant sizes were prospectively established for each period: up to 7 g left in Period 1, up to 6 g in Period 2 and up to 5 g in Period 3. Thyroid function 2 to 3 years after thyroidectomy and the occurrence of surgical complications were compared among the three groups. The relapse rate for Period 1, Period 2, and Period 3 was 14.1%, 12.6%, and 10.9%, respectively, and the rate of euthyroidism decreased and rate of hypothyroidism increased from period to period. Surgical complications increased in Periods 2 and 3. For preventing relapse, the strategy of reducing the thyroid remnant is effective. Subtotal thyroidectomy leaving 3-4 g remnant tissue is a suitable surgical option for Graves' disease.},

Horizontal propagation of activity could explain a shorter latency for moving than for flashed objects but, to our knowledge, no psychophysical data supporting this has been given. We show that two concurrent moving stimuli increase the FLE, presumably due to a latency decrease in movement perception. Our results support the idea that spatial facilitation along the trajectory of a moving object reduces movement perception delay and, therefore, sustains an involvement of latency differences in FLE generation.},

@article{sharpee2008a,
	Abstract = {Understanding neural responses with natural stimuli has increasingly become an essential part of characterizing neural coding. Neural responses are commonly characterized by a linear-nonlinear (LN) model, in which the output of a linear filter applied to the stimulus is transformed by a static nonlinearity to determine neural response. To estimate the linear filter in the LN model, studies of responses to natural stimuli commonly use methods that are unbiased only for a linear model (in which there is no static nonlinearity): spike-triggered averages with correction for stimulus power spectrum, with or without regularization. Although these methods work well for artificial stimuli, such as Gaussian white noise, we show here that they estimate neural filters of LN models from responses to natural stimuli much more poorly. We studied simple cells in cat primary visual cortex. We demonstrate that the filters computed by directly taking the nonlinearity into account have better predictive power and depend less on the stimulus than those computed under the linear model. With noise stimuli, filters computed using the linear and LN models were similar, as predicted theoretically. With natural stimuli, filters of the two models can differ profoundly. Noise and natural stimulus filters differed significantly in spatial properties, but these differences were exaggerated when filters were computed using the linear rather than the LN model. Although regularization of filters computed under the linear model improved their predictive power, it also led to systematic distortions of their spatial frequency profiles, especially at low spatial and temporal frequencies.},

	Abstract = {It has long been assumed that sensory neurons are adapted, through both evolutionary and developmental processes, to the statistical properties of the signals to which they are exposed. Attneave (1954)Barlow (1961) proposed that information theory could provide a link between environmental statistics and neural responses through the concept of coding efficiency. Recent developments in statistical modeling, along with powerful computational tools, have enabled researchers to study more sophisticated statistical models for visual images, to validate these models empirically against large sets of data, and to begin experimentally testing the efficient coding hypothesis for both individual neurons and populations of neurons.},

empirical statistics VS distribution specification


2 different ways to study
1/statistical properties of neuronal responses to natural stimulation

2/derive a model for early sensory processing, define a transformation which maps the stimulus to neuronal responses. This is a probabilistic model.

the constraints on neuronal systems:

informational efficiency ( EFFICIENT CODING) ==> you can't represent all (combinational explosion)
	A.SINGLE NEURON

QUESTION1/ the distribution of single neuronal responses which maximizes information

	B.MULTIPLE NEURONS:
	The responses should satisfy A but also must be independent which means you can not learn anything from one neurons firing anything about the other neurons firing rate. This is a factorial code (Separable joint distribution). Which also means that the conditional probability of neuronal responses given another neurons responses must be a fixed distribution. p(neuron1 | neuron2=R1) must be same as p(neuron1 | neuron2=R3) for rates R1 and R3 
	
	For GAUSSIAN DATA, PCA is a great method. Gaussianity means that WHICHEVER  dimension you project the data to, the response distributions must be gaussian (not satisfied with natural images, simply project natural images into a gabor filter, the distribution of the responses would not be gaussian but rather a highly kurtotic distribution ). PCA + whitening of a multidimensional gaussian data achieves the aim B, MEANING THAT THE NEW AXES (THUS NEURONS) OF THE SPACE WHICH NOW REPRESENTS THE DATA ARE INDEPENDENT!!! 

	If data does not obey gaussianity then ICA would be more adequate to find those axes. PCA does not guarantess finding independent axes. The result of the PCA depends on second order correlations. That means it checks the correlations between different pairs of axes and rotates the axis

GAUSSIAN DATA: it does not have curvatures, depending on the correlation between axis it may be sloped towards a given direction. The projection of the data to any of the axis must be again a gaussian. In summary it should be descibed fairly good with a pureau shaped cloud. It can not have more than one pureau. 
THE RELATIONSHIP TO FOURIER POWER: Well the sinuses and cosines of the fourier base is just a set of another axes in the  space within which the Gaussian Data is represented. The projection of the data to these axes generates again Gaussian distributed data. The variance of this distribution is the POWER SPECTRA of the distribution.

Redundancy of Image Statistics

1D light distribution
	Fly light detectors transforms the non-uniform contrast distribution of natural scenes into a uniformly distributed set of responses. 
	Baddeley found that responses are exponentially distributed (compatible with an optimal coding with a constant firing rate)

Higer Order  Correlations 

QUESTION2/
if one assumes that the images are translation invariant, than Fourier components do result in a valid PCA set meaning that the individual axis of fourier components are independent. This is important to understand why?

HOW TO PROOVE THAT IMAGES ARE NOT GAUSSIAN
two different but similar ways are depicted in the paper: 

1/ if you create 1/f noise, the result is a cloudy image devoid of any structure. This image is  gaussian image meaning that the response distributions across each components is a gaussian distribution. Natural images do not look like this.

2/taking the fourier transform of an image would yield a new basis where each axis is independent. Whitening these would should create an image which has independent coefficients meaning that the pixel values must be gaussian distributed with independent values. This is not the case

3/ projection to gabor axis ==> FIELD's NC (sparseness term is first introduced here) and NATURE PAPER (important detail is that they impose an error term in order to best reconstruct the image)

ICA

ICA seeks a new basis which has axes as independent as possible. You can not infer what one axis is doing by knowing the other axis's value. However the problem is that the results are never perfectly statistically independent. Importantly you can not see this from the Joint distributions!!!. You may see this from the conditional distributions where the variance of the responses on one axis  depends on the responses of the other axis eventhough the expected value is same. This is actually very important to keep in mind when independence needs to be evaluated. That is basically to say that even if the responses are decorrelated they are not independent.

	Abstract = {Areas V1 and V2 of Macaque monkey visual cortex are characterized by unique cytochrome-oxidase (CO)-staining patterns. Initial electrophysiological studies associated CO blobs in V1 with processing of surface properties such as color and brightness and the interblobs with contour information processing. However, many subsequent studies showed controversial results, some supporting this proposal and others failing to find significant functional differences between blobs and interblobs. In this study, we have used optical imaging to map color-selective responses in V1 and V2. In V1, we find striking "blob-like" patterns of color response. Fine alignment of optical maps and CO-stained tissue revealed that color domains in V1 strongly associate with CO blobs. We also find color domains in V1 align along centers of ocular dominance columns. Furthermore, color blobs in V1 have low orientation selectivity and do not overlap with centers of orientation domains. In V2, color domains coincide with thin stripes; orientation-selective domains coincide with thick and pale stripes. We conclude that color and orientation-selective responses are preferentially located in distinct CO compartments in V1 and V2. We propose that the term "blob" encompasses both the concept of "CO blob" and "color domain" in V1.},

	Abstract = {Previous work (Nagy \{\&} Thomas, 2003) showed that signals in different Cardinal color mechanisms could be combined to facilitate search for a color target. Further investigation (Nagy et al., 2003) suggested that signals in one Cardinal color mechanism were used to select a subset of stimuli to be attended, while signals in second Cardinal mechanism were used to discriminate the stimuli within the selected subset. In the studies described below, we asked if observers could use color mechanisms tuned to directions other than the Cardinal directions to select and discriminate stimuli. Observers searched for a single target stimulus that differed in chromaticity from nine distractor stimuli. A two-alternative forced-choice procedure was used to estimate thresholds. Results were consistent with the hypothesis that color mechanisms tuned to many different directions in color space mediate discrimination, but suggest that only signals in Cardinal mechanisms can be used to select stimuli for attention. Results imply that the selection of stimuli for attention on the basis of color may be mediated at the level of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN).},

	Abstract = {Sensory information is encoded by populations of neurons. The responses of individual neurons are inherently noisy, so the brain must interpret this information as reliably as possible. In most situations, the optimal strategy for decoding the population signal is to compute the likelihoods of the stimuli that are consistent with an observed neural response. But it has not been clear how the brain can directly compute likelihoods. Here we present a simple and biologically plausible model that can realize the likelihood function by computing a weighted sum of sensory neuron responses. The model provides the basis for an optimal decoding of sensory information. It explains a variety of psychophysical observations on detection, discrimination and identification, and it also directly predicts the relative contributions that different sensory neurons make to perceptual judgments.},

	Abstract = {Gain modulation is a prominent feature of neuronal activity recorded in behaving animals, but the mechanism by which it occurs is unknown. By introducing a barrage of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances that mimics conditions encountered in vivo into pyramidal neurons in slices of rat somatosensory cortex, we show that the gain of a neuronal response to excitatory drive can be modulated by varying the level of "background" synaptic input. Simultaneously increasing both excitatory and inhibitory background firing rates in a balanced manner results in a divisive gain modulation of the neuronal response without appreciable signal-independent increases in firing rate or spike-train variability. These results suggest that, within active cortical circuits, the overall level of synaptic input to a neuron acts as a gain control signal that modulates responsiveness to excitatory drive.},

	Abstract = {It is widely recognized that viewing a speaker's face enhances vocal communication, although the neural substrates of this phenomenon remain unknown. We propose that the enhancement effect uses the ongoing oscillatory activity of local neuronal ensembles in the primary auditory cortex. Neuronal oscillations reflect rhythmic shifting of neuronal ensembles between high and low excitability states. Our hypothesis holds that oscillations are 'predictively' modulated by visual input, so that related auditory input arrives during a high excitability phase and is thus amplified. We discuss the anatomical substrates and key timing parameters that enable and constrain this effect. Our hypothesis makes testable predictions for future studies and emphasizes the idea that 'background' oscillatory activity is instrumental to cortical sensory processing.},

	Abstract = {Five important trends have emerged from recent work on computational models of focal visual attention that emphasize the bottom-up, image-based control of attentional deployment. First, the perceptual saliency of stimuli critically depends on the surrounding context. Second, a unique 'saliency map' that topographically encodes for stimulus conspicuity over the visual scene has proved to be an efficient and plausible bottom-up control strategy. Third, inhibition of return, the process by which the currently attended location is prevented from being attended again, is a crucial element of attentional deployment. Fourth, attention and eye movements tightly interplay, posing computational challenges with respect to the coordinate system used to control attention. And last, scene understanding and object recognition strongly constrain the selection of attended locations. Insights from these five key areas provide a framework for a computational and neurobiological understanding of visual attention.},

	Abstract = {We combined psychophysical and transcranial magnetic stimulation studies to investigate the dynamics of action anticipation and its underlying neural correlates in professional basketball players. Athletes predicted the success of free shots at a basket earlier and more accurately than did individuals with comparable visual experience (coaches or sports journalists) and novices. Moreover, performance between athletes and the other groups differed before the ball was seen to leave the model's hands, suggesting that athletes predicted the basket shot's fate by reading the body kinematics. Both visuo-motor and visual experts showed a selective increase of motor-evoked potentials during observation of basket shots. However, only athletes showed a time-specific motor activation during observation of erroneous basket throws. Results suggest that achieving excellence in sports may be related to the fine-tuning of specific anticipatory 'resonance' mechanisms that endow elite athletes' brains with the ability to predict others' actions ahead of their realization.},

	Abstract = {The sensory pathways of animals are well adapted to processing a special class of signals, namely stimuli from the animal's environment. An important fact about natural stimuli is that they are typically very redundant and hence the sampled representation of these signals formed by the array of sensory cells is inefficient. One could argue for some animals and pathways, as the author does in this review, that efficiency of information representation in the nervous system has several evolutionary advantages. Consequently, one might expect that much of the processing in the early levels of these sensory pathways could be dedicated towards recording incoming signals into a more efficient form. The author explores the principle of efficiency of information representation as a design principle for sensory processing. He gives a preliminary discussion on how this principle could be applied in general to predict neural processing and then discuss concretely some neural systems where it recently has been shown to be successful. In particular, he examines the fly's LMC coding strategy and the mammalian retinal coding in the spatial, temporal and chromatic domains.},

	Abstract = {Neocortical "theta" oscillation (5-12 Hz) has been observed in animals and human subjects but little is known about how the oscillation is organized in the cortical intrinsic networks. Here we use voltage-sensitive dye and optical imaging to study a carbachol/bicuculline induced theta ( approximately 8 Hz) oscillation in rat neocortical slices. The imaging has large signal-to-noise ratio, allowing us to map the phase distribution over the neocortical tissue during the oscillation. The oscillation was organized as spontaneous epochs and each epoch was composed of a "first spike," a "regular" period (with relatively stable frequency and amplitude), and an "irregular" period (with variable frequency and amplitude) of oscillations. During each cycle of the regular oscillation, one wave of activation propagated horizontally (parallel to the cortical lamina) across the cortical section at a velocity of approximately 50 mm/s. Vertically the activity was synchronized through all cortical layers. This pattern of one propagating wave associated with one oscillation cycle was seen during all the regular cycles. The oscillation frequency varied noticeably at two neighboring horizontal locations (330 microm apart), suggesting that the oscillation is locally organized and each local oscillator is about </=300 microm wide horizontally. During irregular oscillations, the spatiotemporal patterns were complex and sometimes the vertical synchronization decomposed, suggesting a de-coupling among local oscillators. Our data suggested that neocortical theta oscillation is sustained by multiple local oscillators. The coupling regime among the oscillators may determine the spatiotemporal pattern and switching between propagating waves and irregular patterns.},

	Abstract = {The close relationship between iodine intake and the effects of anti-thyroid drugs (ATD) for Graves' disease (GD) has been well established. However, it remains unknown whether restriction of dietary iodine improves the effect of ATD. This study aimed to clarify this issue in Japanese patients with GD who routinely ingest large amounts of dietary iodine. We performed a prospective clinical study in 81 patients with newly diagnosed GD who were divided into an iodine restricted group and a control group. Urinary iodine, thyroid hormones and TSH receptor antibody were measured during the first 8 weeks of ATD therapy. Urinary iodine concentrations in the iodine restricted group were significantly lower than in the control group (p=0.043). However, there were no significant differences in the decrease of thyroid hormones and TSH receptor antibody between the two groups. Restriction of dietary iodine does not ameliorate the effect of ATD therapy for GD in an area of excessive iodine intake.},

	Abstract = {High-frequency stimulation (HFS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is a well-established therapy for patients with severe Parkinson's disease (PD), but its mechanism of action is unclear. Exaggerated oscillatory synchronization in the beta (13-30 Hz) frequency band has been associated with bradykinesia in patients with PD. Accordingly, we tested the hypothesis that the clinical benefit exerted by STN HFS is accompanied by suppression of local beta activity. To this end, we explored the after effects of STN HFS on the oscillatory local field potential (LFP) activity recorded from the STN immediately after the cessation of HFS in 11 PD patients. Only patients that demonstrated a temporary persistence of clinical benefit after cessation of HFS were analyzed. STN HFS led to a significant reduction in STN LFP beta activity for 12 s after the end of stimulation and a decrease in motor cortical-STN coherence in the beta band over the same time period. The reduction in LFP beta activity correlated with the movement amplitude during a simple motor task, so that a smaller amount of beta activity was associated with better task performance. These features were absent when power in the 5-12 Hz frequency band was considered. Our findings suggest that HFS may act by modulating pathological patterns of synchronized oscillations, specifically by reduction of pathological beta activity in PD.},

	Abstract = {Tactile information is actively acquired and processed in the brain through concerted interactions between movement and sensation. Somatosensory input is often the result of self-generated movement during the active touch of objects, and conversely, sensory information is used to refine motor control. There must therefore be important interactions between sensory and motor pathways, which we chose to investigate in the mouse whisker sensorimotor system. Voltage-sensitive dye was applied to the neocortex of mice to directly image the membrane potential dynamics of sensorimotor cortex with subcolumnar spatial resolution and millisecond temporal precision. Single brief whisker deflections evoked highly distributed depolarizing cortical sensory responses, which began in the primary somatosensory barrel cortex and subsequently excited the whisker motor cortex. The spread of sensory information to motor cortex was dynamically regulated by behavior and correlated with the generation of sensory-evoked whisker movement. Sensory processing in motor cortex may therefore contribute significantly to active tactile sensory perception.},

@article{thompson2005a,
	Abstract = {Models of attention and saccade target selection propose that within the brain there is a topographic map of visual salience that combines bottom-up and top-down influences to identify locations for further processing. The results of a series of experiments with monkeys performing visual search tasks have identified a population of frontal eye field (FEF) visually responsive neurons that exhibit all of the characteristics of a visual salience map. The activity of these FEF neurons is not sensitive to specific features of visual stimuli; but instead, their activity evolves over time to select the target of the search array. This selective activation reflects both the bottom-up intrinsic conspicuousness of the stimuli and the top-down knowledge and goals of the viewer. The peak response within FEF specifies the target for the overt gaze shift. However, the selective activity in FEF is not in itself a motor command because the magnitude of activation reflects the relative behavioral significance of the different stimuli in the visual scene and occurs even when no saccade is made. Identifying a visual salience map in FEF validates the theoretical concept of a salience map in many models of attention. In addition, it strengthens the emerging view that FEF is not only involved in producing overt gaze shifts, but is also important for directing covert spatial attention.},

	Abstract = {To examine the role of primary visual cortex in visuospatial integration, we studied the spatial arrangement of contextual interactions in the response properties of neurons in primary visual cortex of alert monkeys and in human perception. We found a spatial segregation of opposing contextual interactions. At the level of cortical neurons, excitatory interactions were located along the ends of receptive fields, while inhibitory interactions were strongest along the orthogonal axis. Parallel psychophysical studies in human observers showed opposing contextual interactions surrounding a target line with a similar spatial distribution. The results suggest that V1 neurons can participate in multiple perceptual processes via spatially segregated and functionally distinct components of their receptive fields.},

	Abstract = {Here we review the etiology, diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and clinical presentation of hyperthyroidism in neonates/infants, children, and adolescents and the standard and adjunct modalities used for its treatment. The most common cause of hyperthyroidism in pediatric patients is Graves' disease. The main options for its management include antithyroid drugs, surgery, and radioiodine therapy. Despite collective experience covering more than 4 decades in the management of hyperthyroidism in children, controversy still abounds regarding the choice of treatments. None of the current treatment options is ideal. Each has risks and selection should be tailored to individual patients, especially in view of the absence of large, prospective, randomized outcome studies. Finally, we discuss the diagnosis and management of less common causes of pediatric hyperthyroidism, including non-autoimmune causes in neonates, autonomously functioning thyroid adenomas, destructive thyroiditis, excessive or inappropriate thyroid-stimulating hormone production, excessive ingestion of thyroid hormone and exposure to large, stable iodine loads.},

	Abstract = {Early sensory processing can play a critical role in sensing environmental cues. We have investigated the physiological and behavioral function of gain control at the first synapse of olfactory processing in Drosophila. Olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) express the GABA(B) receptor (GABA(B)R), and its expression expands the dynamic range of ORN synaptic transmission that is preserved in projection neuron responses. Strikingly, each ORN channel has a unique baseline level of GABA(B)R expression. ORNs that sense the aversive odorant CO(2) do not express GABA(B)Rs and do not have significant presynaptic inhibition. In contrast, pheromone-sensing ORNs express a high level of GABA(B)Rs and exhibit strong presynaptic inhibition. Furthermore, pheromone-dependent mate localization is impaired in flies that lack GABA(B)Rs in specific ORNs. These findings indicate that different olfactory receptor channels employ heterogeneous presynaptic gain control as a mechanism to allow an animal's innate behavioral responses to match its ecological needs.},

	Abstract = {The horizontal network in visual cortex layer 2/3 is implicated in numerous psychophysical and physiological properties. To investigate the spatial and temporal distribution of excitation and inhibition evoked by this network, we used voltage-sensitive dyes to image the responses to focal electrical stimulation in tangential slices of ferret visual cortex layer 2/3. The resulting optical patterns included a diffuse zone of activation near the stimulation site and numerous ovoid domains throughout the slice. In contrast to the fixed anatomy of the horizontal connections, substantial shifts in both space and time were evident in the distribution of population-based neuronal activity during stimulus trains. Both of these shifts relied on inhibitory synaptic potentials, suggesting that inhibition driven by horizontal connections sculpts the distribution of activity in this cortical network.},

	Abstract = {Here we describe the properties of a synapse in the Drosophila antennal lobe and show how they can explain certain sensory computations in this brain region. The synapse between olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) and projection neurons (PNs) is very strong, reflecting a large number of release sites and high release probability. This is likely one reason why weak ORN odor responses are amplified in PNs. Furthermore, the amplitude of unitary synaptic currents in a PN is matched to the size of its dendritic arbor. This matching may compensate for a lower input resistance of larger dendrites to produce uniform depolarization across PN types. Consistent with this idea, a genetic manipulation that lowers input resistance increases unitary synaptic currents. Finally, strong stimuli produce short-term depression at this synapse. This helps explain why PN odor responses are transient, and why strong ORN odor responses are not amplified as powerfully as weak responses.},

	Abstract = {Motor control requires the generation of a precise temporal sequence of control signals sent to the skeletal musculature. We describe an experiment that, for good performance, requires human subjects to plan movements taking into account uncertainty in their movement duration and the increase in that uncertainty with increasing movement duration. We do this by rewarding movements performed within a specified time window, and penalizing slower movements in some conditions and faster movements in others. Our results indicate that subjects compensated for their natural duration-dependent temporal uncertainty as well as an overall increase in temporal uncertainty that was imposed experimentally. Their compensation for temporal uncertainty, both the natural duration-dependent and imposed overall components, was nearly optimal in the sense of maximizing expected gain in the task. The motor system is able to model its temporal uncertainty and compensate for that uncertainty so as to optimize the consequences of movement.},

	Abstract = {Our aim was to investigate the patterns of functional inputs and outputs from individual barrels in the mouse somatosensory cortex, and to test the hypothesis that individual barrels in layer IV are functionally independent of direct inputs from neighboring barrels. In a mouse in vitro slice preparation of the barrel cortex, we recorded voltage-sensitive dye signals evoked in response to microstimulation of a single barrel. Activity propagated from the stimulated barrel to the supragranular layers, where it spread to activate several barrel columns. However, in no instance did activity propagate directly from the stimulated barrel to neighboring barrels. Neither suppression of GABAergic inhibition, nor activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, revealed direct interbarrel interactions. By contrast, microstimulation in the supra- or infragranular layers resulted in direct propagation of activity to neighboring barrel columns. We conclude that the neurons within individual barrels are functionally independent of direct inputs from neighboring barrels. This suggests that the response properties of layer IV barrel neurons are shaped primarily by their presynaptic thalamic afferents and by intrabarrel interactions, and that these responses are independent of direct inputs from neighboring barrels.},

	Abstract = {CONTEXT: Patients treated with radioiodine (RAI) for hyperthyroidism have been reported to be at increased risk for death. It is not clear whether the increased mortality is due to hyperthyroidism itself or the effect of RAI. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to compare the mortality of hyperthyroid patients treated with RAI with that of an age- and gender-matched reference population. DESIGN: We conducted a population-based cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2793 patients who received RAI treatment for hyperthyroidism in Tampere University Hospital between 1965 and 2002, and 2793 reference subjects were followed for a median of 9 yr. RESULTS: Record linkage with Statistics Finland identified all-cause mortality of 453 vs. 406 per 10,000 person-years in the patients and controls [rate ratio (RR) 1.12; 95% confidence interval 1.03-1.20]. Cerebrovascular diseases accounted for most of the increased mortality among patients (RR 1.40), and mortality from cancer increased (RR 1.29) as well. The risk of death increased in patients older than 60 yr at treatment. Mortality increased with the dose of RAI and was elevated in patients with nodular thyroid disease, but not in those with Graves' disease. Previous treatment with partial thyroidectomy decreased, whereas antithyroid medication did not affect mortality. In Cox regression analysis, RAI-treated hyperthyroidism (RR 1.56) and age (RR 1.10/1 yr) increased, and the development of hypothyroidism (RR 0.52) reduced mortality significantly. CONCLUSIONS: Hyperthyroidism per se probably accounts for the increased cerebrovascular mortality after RAI treatment. Our results of increased cerebrovascular and cancer mortality emphasize the need for long-term vigilance concerning patients treated with RAI.},

	Abstract = {We describe a model of visual processing in which feedback connections from a higher- to a lower-order visual cortical area carry predictions of lower-level neural activities, whereas the feedforward connections carry the residual errors between the predictions and the actual lower-level activities. When exposed to natural images, a hierarchical network of model neurons implementing such a model developed simple-cell-like receptive fields. A subset of neurons responsible for carrying the residual errors showed endstopping and other extra-classical receptive-field effects. These results suggest that rather than being exclusively feedforward phenomena, nonclassical surround effects in the visual cortex may also result from cortico-cortical feedback as a consequence of the visual system using an efficient hierarchical strategy for encoding natural images.},

	Abstract = {Shape is represented in the visual system by patterns of activity across populations of neurons. We studied the population code for shape in area V4 of macaque monkeys, which is part of the ventral (object-related) pathway in primate visual cortex. We have previously found that many macaque V4 neurons are tuned for the curvature and object-centered position of boundary fragments (such as 'concavity on the right'). Here we tested the hypothesis that populations of such cells represent complete shapes as aggregates of boundary fragments. To estimate the population representation of a given shape, we scaled each cell's tuning peak by its response to that shape, summed across cells and smoothed. The resulting population response surface contained 3-8 peaks that represented major boundary features and could be used to reconstruct (approximately) the original shape. This exemplifies how a multi-peaked neural population response can represent a complex stimulus in terms of its constituent elements.},

It is thin and elastic enough to allow microelectrode to pass through without any damage, using full visual control to target the electrode to the desirable recording site. This implant has proved crucial for maintaining the cortex in a good physiological condition and for preserving its optical characteristics that are necessary for optical imaging. We describe the details of the surgical implantation of the silicone dural substitute, the maintenance of the exposed cortex over long periods of time, the cortical reaction to this implant and its possible clinical implications in humans, and the rehabilitation procedure in monkeys.},

@article{heimendahl2007a,
	Abstract = {Rats and mice palpate objects with their whiskers to generate tactile sensations. This form of active sensing endows the animals with the capacity for fast and accurate texture discrimination. The present work is aimed at understanding the nature of the underlying cortical signals. We recorded neuronal activity from barrel cortex while rats used their whiskers to discriminate between rough and smooth textures. On whisker contact with either texture, firing rate increased by a factor of two to ten. Average firing rate was significantly higher for rough than for smooth textures, and we therefore propose firing rate as the fundamental coding mechanism. The rat, however, cannot take an average across trials, but must make an immediate decision using the signals generated on each trial. To estimate single-trial signals, we calculated the mutual information between stimulus and firing rate in the time window leading to the rat's observed choice. Activity during the last 75 ms before choice transmitted the most informative signal; in this window, neuronal clusters carried, on average, 0.03 bits of information about the stimulus on trials in which the rat's behavioral response was correct. To understand how cortical activity guides behavior, we examined responses in incorrect trials and found that, in contrast to correct trials, neuronal firing rate was higher for smooth than for rough textures. Analysis of high-speed films suggested that the inappropriate signal on incorrect trials was due, at least in part, to nonoptimal whisker contact. In conclusion, these data suggest that barrel cortex firing rate on each trial leads directly to the animal's judgment of texture.},

@article{lesica2008a,
	Abstract = {The reasons for using natural stimuli to study sensory function are quickly mounting, as recent studies have revealed important differences in neural responses to natural and artificial stimuli. However, natural stimuli typically contain strong correlations and are spherically asymmetric (i.e. stimulus intensities are not symmetrically distributed around the mean), and these statistical complexities can bias receptive field (RF) estimates when standard techniques such as spike-triggered averaging or reverse correlation are used. While a number of approaches have been developed to explicitly correct the bias due to stimulus correlations, there is no complementary technique to correct the bias due to stimulus asymmetries. Here, we develop a method for RF estimation that corrects reverse correlation RF estimates for the spherical asymmetries present in natural stimuli. Using simulated neural responses, we demonstrate how stimulus asymmetries can bias reverse-correlation RF estimates (even for uncorrelated stimuli) and illustrate how this bias can be removed by explicit correction. We demonstrate the utility of the asymmetry correction method under experimental conditions by estimating RFs from the responses of retinal ganglion cells to natural stimuli and using these RFs to predict responses to novel stimuli.},

@article{majaj2007a,
	Abstract = {Direction-selective neurons in primary visual cortex have small receptive fields that encode the motions of local features. These motions often differ from the motion of the object to which they belong and must therefore be integrated elsewhere. A candidate site for this integration is visual cortical area MT (V5), in which cells with large receptive fields compute the motion of patterns. Previous studies of motion integration in MT have used stimuli that fill the receptive field, and thus do not test whether motion information is really integrated across this whole area. For each MT neuron, we identified two regions ("patches") within the receptive field that were approximately equally effective in driving responses. We then measured responses to plaids whose component gratings overlapped within a patch, and compared them with responses to the same component gratings presented in separate patches. Cells that were selective for the direction of motion of the whole pattern when the gratings overlapped lost this selectivity when the gratings were separated and became selective instead for the direction of motion of the individual components. If MT cells simply pooled all of the inputs that endow them with a receptive field, they would encode all of the motions in the receptive field as belonging to a single object. Our results indicate instead that critical elements of the computations underlying pattern-direction selectivity in MT are done locally, on a scale smaller than the whole receptive field.},

What motivates humans to punish noncooperators is likely a combination of aversion to both unfair outcomes and unfair intentions.

Like humans, chimpanzees retaliate against personally harmful actions, but unlike humans, they are indifferent to simply personally disadvantageous outcomes and are therefore not spiteful.},

	Abstract = {Despite the lack of direct evidence, it is generally believed that top-down signals are mediated by the abundant feedback connections from higher- to lower-order sensory areas. Here we provide direct evidence for a top-down mechanism. We stained the visual cortex of the ferret with a voltage-sensitive dye and presented a short-duration contrast square. This elicited an initial feedforward and lateral spreading depolarization at the square representation in areas 17 and 18. After a delay, a broad feedback wave (FBW) of neuron peak depolarization traveled from areas 21 and 19 toward areas 18 and 17. In areas 18 and 17, the FBW contributed the peak depolarization of dendrites of the neurons representing the square, after which the neurons decreased their depolarization and firing. Thereafter, the peak depolarization surrounded the figure representation over most of areas 17 and 18 representing the background. Thus, the FBW is an example of a well behaved long-range communication from higher-order visual areas to areas 18 and 17, collectively addressing very large populations of neurons representing the visual scene. Through local interaction with feedforward and lateral spreading depolarization, the FBW differentially activates neurons representing the object and neurons representing the background.},

@article{hooser2005a,
	Abstract = {In mammalian neocortex, the orderly arrangement of columns of neurons is thought to be a fundamental organizing principle. In primary visual cortex (V1), neurons respond preferentially to bars of a particular orientation, and, in many mammals, these orientation-selective cells are arranged in a semiregular, smoothly varying map across the cortical surface. Curiously, orientation maps have not been found in rodents or lagomorphs. To explore whether this lack of organization in previously studied rodents could be attributable to low visual acuity, poorly differentiated visual brain areas, or small absolute V1 size, we examined V1 organization of a larger, highly visual rodent, the gray squirrel. Using intrinsic signal optical imaging and single-cell recordings, we found no evidence of an orientation map, suggesting that formation of orientation maps depends on mechanisms not found in rodents. We did find robust orientation tuning of single cells, and this tuning was invariant to stimulus contrast. Therefore, it seems unlikely that orientation maps are important for orientation tuning or its contrast invariance in V1. In vertical electrode penetrations, we found little evidence for columnar organization of orientation-selective neurons and little evidence for local anisotropy of orientation preferences. We conclude that an orderly and columnar arrangement of functional response properties is not a universal characteristic of cortical architecture.},

@article{carreira-perpinan2002a,
	Abstract = {The elegant regularity of maps of variables such as ocular dominance, orientation, and spatial frequency in primary visual cortex has prompted many people to suggest that their structure could be explained by an optimization principle. Up to now, the standard way to test this hypothesis has been to generate artificial maps by optimizing a hypothesized objective function and then to compare these artificial maps with real maps using a variety of quantitative criteria. If the artificial maps are similar to the real maps, this provides some evidence that the real cortex may be optimizing a similar function to the one hypothesized. Recently, a more direct method has been proposed for testing whether real maps represent local optima of an objective function (Swindale, Shoham, Grinvald, Bonhoeffer, {\&} Hubener, 2000). In this approach, the value of the hypothesized function is calculated for a real map, and then the real map is perturbed in certain ways and the function recalculated. If each of these perturbations leads to a worsening of the function, it is tempting to conclude that the real map is quite likely to represent a local optimum of that function. In this article, we argue that such perturbation results provide only weak evidence in favor of the optimization hypothesis.},

@article{felleman1991a,
	Abstract = {In recent years, many new cortical areas have been identified in the macaque monkey. The number of iden tified connections hetween areas has increased even more dramatically. We report here on (1) a summary of the layout of cortical areas associated with vision and with other modalities, (2) a computerized database for storing and representing large amounts of information on connectivity patterns, and (3) the application of these data to the analysis of hierarchical organization of the cerebral cortex. Our analysis concentrates on the visual system, which includes 25 neocortical areas that are predominantly or exclusively visual in function, plus an additional 7 areas that we regard as visual-association areas on the basis of their extensive visual inputs. A total of 305 connections among these 32 visual and visual-association areas have been reported. This represents 31% of the possible number of pathways it each area were connected with all others. The actual degree of connectivity is likely to he closer to 40%. The great majority of pathways involve reciprocal connections be tween areas. There are also extensive connections with cortical areas outside the visual system proper, including the somatosensory cortex, as well as neocortical, transitional, and archicortical regions in the temporal and frontal lobes. In the somatosensory/motor system, there are 62 identified pathways linking 13 cortical areas, suggesting an overall connectivity of about 40%. Based on the laminar patterns of connections between areas, we propose a hierarchy of visual areas and of somato sensory/motor areas that is more comprehensive thao those suggested in other recent studies. The current version of the visual hierarchy includes 10 levels of cortical processing. Altogether, it contains 14 levels if one includes the retina and lateral geniculate nucleus at the bottom as well as the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus at the top. Within this hierarchy, there are multiple, intertwined processing streams, which, at a low level, are related to the compartmental organization of areas V1 and V2 and, at a high level, are related to the distinction between processing centers in the temporal and parietal lobes. However, there are some pathways and relationships (about 10% of the total) whose descriptions do not fit cleanly into this hierarchical scheme for one reason or another. In most instances, though, it is unclear whether these represent genuine exceptions to a strict hierarchy rather than inaccuracies or uncertainties in the reported assignment.},

	Abstract = {While we know that the neocortex occupies 85% of our brains and that its circuits allow an enormous flexibility and repertoire of behavior (not to mention unexplained phenomena like consciousness), a century after Cajal we have very little knowledge of the details of the cortical circuits or their mode of function. One simplifying hypothesis that has existed since Cajal is that the neocortex consists of repeated copies of the same fundamental circuit. However, finding that fundamental circuit has proved elusive, although partial drafts of a "canonical circuit" appear in many different guises of structure and function. Here, we review some critical stages in the history of this quest. In doing so, we consider the style of cortical computation in relation to the neuronal machinery that supports it. We conclude that the structure and function of cortex honors two major computational principles: "just-enough" and "just-in-time."},

	Abstract = {Human visual speed perception is qualitatively consistent with a Bayesian observer that optimally combines noisy measurements with a prior preference for lower speeds. Quantitative validation of this model, however, is difficult because the precise noise characteristics and prior expectations are unknown. Here, we present an augmented observer model that accounts for the variability of subjective responses in a speed discrimination task. This allowed us to infer the shape of the prior probability as well as the internal noise characteristics directly from psychophysical data. For all subjects, we found that the fitted model provides an accurate description of the data across a wide range of stimulus parameters. The inferred prior distribution shows significantly heavier tails than a Gaussian, and the amplitude of the internal noise is approximately proportional to stimulus speed and depends inversely on stimulus contrast. The framework is general and should prove applicable to other experiments and perceptual modalities.},

The present study was designed in three steps: (1) 88 female patients with AIT (mean age = 40.1 +/- 13.3 years) were randomized into two groups according to their initial serum TSH, thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) concentrations, and age. All the patients were receiving L-thyroxine to keep serum TSH <or=2 mIU/l. Group S2 (n = 48, mean TPOAb = 803.9 +/- 483.8 IU/ml) received 200 microg L-selenomethionine per day, orally for 3 months, and group C (n = 40, mean TPOAb = 770.3 +/- 406.2 IU/ml) received placebo. (2) 40 volunteers of group S2 were randomized into two age- and TPOAb-matched groups. Group S22 (n = 20) went on taking L-selenomethionine 200 microg/day, while others (group S21) lowered the dose to 100 microg/day. (3) 12 patients of group S22 (group S222) went on taking L-selenomethionine 200 microg/day, while 12 patients of group S21 (S212) increased the dose to 200 microg/day. Serum titers of TPOAb decreased significantly in group S2 (26.2%, P < 0.001), group S22 (23.7%, P < 0.01) and group S212 (30.3%, P < 0.01). There were no significant changes in group C and group S222 (P > 0.05). TPOAb titers increased significantly in group S21 (38.1%, P < 0.01). A significant decrease in thyroglobulin antibody titers was only noted in group S2 (5.2%, P < 0.01). L-selenomethionine substitution suppresses serum concentrations of TPOAb in patients with AIT, but suppression requires doses higher than 100 microg/day which is sufficient to maximize glutathione peroxidase activities. The suppression rate decreases with time.},

	Abstract = {An experiment is described to measure the distracting effects of advertisements on the conspicuity of routing signs in realistic scenes. Slides of railway station scenes were shown in which subjects had to search for a target word used in a routing sign present in the scene. Eye movements were recorded to determine search time and number of fixations during search time. Both search time and number of fixations increased systematically with the number of advertisements in two of the three experimental scenes. The distribution of fixations over the scenes is discussed.},

	Abstract = {Here we ask whether visual response pattern varies with position in the cortical microcircuit by comparing the structure of receptive fields recorded from the different layers of the cat's primary visual cortex. We used whole-cell recording in vivo to show the spatial distribution of visually evoked excitatory and inhibitory inputs and to stain individual neurons. We quantified the distribution of 'On' and 'Off' responses and the presence of spatially opponent excitation and inhibition within the receptive field. The thalamorecipient layers (4 and upper 6) were dominated by simple cells, as defined by two criteria: they had separated On and Off subregions, and they had push-pull responses (in a given subregion, stimuli of the opposite contrast evoked responses of the opposite sign). Other types of response profile correlated with laminar location as well. Thus, connections unique to each visual cortical layer are likely to serve distinct functions.},

	Abstract = {Most algorithms currently used to model synaptic plasticity in self-organizing cortical networks suppose that the change in synaptic efficacy is governed by the same structuring factor, i.e., the temporal correlation of activity between pre- and postsynaptic neurons. Functional predictions generated by such algorithms have been tested electrophysiologically in the visual cortex of anesthetized and paralyzed cats. Supervised learning procedures were applied at the cellular level to change receptive field (RF) properties during the time of recording of an individual functionally identified cell. The protocols were devised as cellular analogs of the plasticity of RF properties, which is normally expressed during a critical period of postnatal development. We summarize here evidence demonstrating that changes in covariance between afferent input and postsynaptic response imposed during extracellular and intracellular conditioning can acutely induce selective long-lasting up- and down-regulations of visual responses. The functional properties that could be modified in 40% of cells submitted to differential pairing protocols include ocular dominance, orientation selectivity and orientation preference, interocular orientation disparity, and the relative dominance of ON and OFF responses. Since changes in RF properties can be induced in the adult as well, our findings also suggest that similar activity-dependent processes may occur during development and during active phases of learning under the supervision of behavioral attention or contextual signals. Such potential for plasticity in primary visual cortical neurons suggests the existence of a hidden connectivity expressing a wider functional competence than the one revealed at the spiking level. In particular, in the spatial domain the sensory synaptic integration field is larger than the classical discharge field. It can be shaped by supervised learning and its subthreshold extent can be unmasked by the pharmacological blockade of intracortical inhibition.},

	Abstract = {It is hypothesized that eye movements are used to coordinate elements of a mental model with elements of the visual field. In two experiments, eye movements were recorded while observers imagined or recalled objects that were not present in the visual display. In both cases, observers spontaneously looked at particular blank regions of space in a systematic fashion, to manipulate and organize spatial relationships between mental and/or retinal images. These results contribute to evidence that interpreting a linguistic description of a visual scene requires a spatial (mental model) representation, and they support claims regarding the allocation of position markers in visual space for the manipulation of visual attention. More broadly, our results point to a concrete embodiment of cognition, in that a construction of a mental image is almost "acted out" by the eye movements, and a mental search of internal memory is accompanied by an ocolumotor search of external space.},

	Abstract = {To form a coherent percept of the environment, our brain combines information from different senses. Such multisensory integration occurs in higher association cortices; but supposedly, it also occurs in early sensory areas. Confirming the latter hypothesis, we unequivocally demonstrate supra-additive integration of touch and sound stimulation at the second stage of the auditory cortex. Using high-resolution fMRI of the macaque monkey, we quantified the integration of auditory broad-band noise and tactile stimulation of hand and foot in anaesthetized animals. Integration was found posterior to and along the lateral side of the primary auditory cortex in the caudal auditory belt. Integration was stronger for temporally coincident stimuli and obeyed the principle of inverse effectiveness: greater enhancement for less effective stimuli. These findings demonstrates that multisensory integration occurs early and close to primary sensory areas and--because it occurs in anaesthetized animals--suggests that this integration is mediated by preattentive bottom-up mechanisms.},

@article{lesica2006b,
	Abstract = {In the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus, visual stimulation produces two distinct types of responses known as tonic and burst. Due to the dynamics of the T-type Ca(2+) channels involved in burst generation, the type of response evoked by a particular stimulus depends on the resting membrane potential, which is controlled by a network of modulatory connections from other brain areas. In this study, we use simulated responses to natural scene movies to describe how modulatory and stimulus-driven changes in LGN membrane potential interact to determine the luminance sequences that trigger burst responses. We find that at low resting potentials, when the T channels are de-inactivated and bursts are relatively frequent, an excitatory stimulus transient alone is sufficient to evoke a burst. However, to evoke a burst at high resting potentials, when the T channels are inactivated and bursts are relatively rare, prolonged inhibitory stimulation followed by an excitatory transient is required. We also observe evidence of these effects in vivo, where analysis of experimental recordings demonstrates that the luminance sequences that trigger bursts can vary dramatically with the overall burst percentage of the response. To characterize the functional consequences of the effects of resting potential on burst generation, we simulate LGN responses to different luminance sequences at a range of resting potentials with and without a mechanism for generating bursts. Using analysis based on signal detection theory, we show that bursts enhance detection of specific luminance sequences, ranging from the onset of excitatory sequences at low resting potentials to the offset of inhibitory sequences at high resting potentials. These results suggest a dynamic role for burst responses during visual processing that may change according to behavioral state.},

	Abstract = {Contrast sensitivity for square-wave gratings of spatial frequencies between 0.44 and 33.2 cycles/deg was determined for exposure durations between 11 and 500 msec. The space-average luminance of the targets was kept constant at 10 mL, regardless of contrast, and equal to that of the pre- and post-exposure fields, which contained a cross-hair reticle to help maintain accommodation and fixation. At the longest exposure duration (500 msec) the contrast sensitivity function exhibited both the high- and the low-frequency declines described by previous investigators. At the briefest exposure duration tested (11 msec), the low-frequency decline of contrast sensitivity was virtually absent. Log contrast sensitivity improves with increasing exposure duration, but more for high-frequency than for low-frequency gratings. These results are compatible with the assumption that there is a time delay in the occurrence of inhibitory interactions in the retina.},

	Abstract = {Humans and other animals must often make decisions on the basis of imperfect evidence. Statisticians use measures such as P values to assign degrees of confidence to propositions, but little is known about how the brain computes confidence estimates about decisions. We explored this issue using behavioural analysis and neural recordings in rats in combination with computational modelling. Subjects were trained to perform an odour categorization task that allowed decision confidence to be manipulated by varying the distance of the test stimulus to the category boundary. To understand how confidence could be computed along with the choice itself, using standard models of decision-making, we defined a simple measure that quantified the quality of the evidence contributing to a particular decision. Here we show that the firing rates of many single neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex match closely to the predictions of confidence models and cannot be readily explained by alternative mechanisms, such as learning stimulus-outcome associations. Moreover, when tested using a delayed reward version of the task, we found that rats' willingness to wait for rewards increased with confidence, as predicted by the theoretical model. These results indicate that confidence estimates, previously suggested to require 'metacognition' and conscious awareness are available even in the rodent brain, can be computed with relatively simple operations, and can drive adaptive behaviour. We suggest that confidence estimation may be a fundamental and ubiquitous component of decision-making.},

	Abstract = {More than 30 years after Hubel and Wiesel first described orientation selectivity in the mammalian visual cortex, the mechanism that gives rise to this property is still controversial. Hubel and Wiesel proposed a simple model for the origin of orientation tuning, in which the circularly symmetrical receptive fields of neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus that excite a cortical simple cell are arranged in rows. Since this model was proposed, several experiments and neuronal simulations have suggested that the connectivity between the lateral geniculate nucleus and the cortex is not well organized in an orientation-specific fashion, and that orientation tuning arises instead from extensive interactions within the cortex. To test these models we have recorded visually evoked synaptic potentials in simple cells while cooling the cortex, which largely inactivates the cortical network, but leaves geniculate synaptic input functional. We report that the orientation tuning of these potentials is almost unaffected by cooling the cortex, in agreement with Hubel and Wiesel's original proposal.},

	Abstract = {There is currently much controversy about which, if any, mental states chimpanzees and other nonhuman primates understand. In the current two studies we tested both chimpanzees' and human children's understanding of both knowledge-ignorance and false belief - in the same experimental paradigm involving competition with a conspecific. We found that whereas 6-year-old children understood both of these mental states, chimpanzees understood knowledge-ignorance but not false belief. After ruling out various alternative explanations of these and related findings, we conclude that in at least some situations chimpanzees know what others know. Possible explanations for their failure in the highly similar false belief task are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Although saccadic eye movements can radically change the retinal image, perceptually their impact is surprisingly small. Here, we investigate possible neuronal correlates of saccadic suppression in cats freely viewing natural stimuli. By comparing changes attributable to saccadic events with passive stimulus changes, we find that during saccades: (i) evoked and induced activity is reduced in areas 18 and 21a by equal amounts, (ii) the variability of neuronal activity with stimulus category is abolished in both areas, and (iii) the high-power transient induced by stimulus change is not observed. These results present electrophysiological evidence for saccadic suppression at the level of primary and higher visual cortex under natural conditions.},

	Abstract = {The illusion of apparent motion can be induced when visual stimuli are successively presented at different locations. It has been shown in previous studies that motion-sensitive regions in extrastriate cortex are relevant for the processing of apparent motion, but it is unclear whether primary visual cortex (V1) is also involved in the representation of the illusory motion path. We investigated, in human subjects, apparent-motion-related activity in patches of V1 representing locations along the path of illusory stimulus motion using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Here we show that apparent motion caused a blood-oxygenation-level-dependent response along the V1 representations of the apparent-motion path, including regions that were not directly activated by the apparent-motion-inducing stimuli. This response was unaltered when participants had to perform an attention-demanding task that diverted their attention away from the stimulus. With a bistable motion quartet, we confirmed that the activity was related to the conscious perception of movement. Our data suggest that V1 is part of the network that represents the illusory path of apparent motion. The activation in V1 can be explained either by lateral interactions within V1 or by feedback mechanisms from higher visual areas, especially the motion-sensitive human MT/V5 complex.},

	Abstract = {The extent to which synaptic activity can signal a sensory stimulus limits the information available to a neuron. We determined the contribution of individual synapses to sensory representation by recording excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in cerebellar granule cells during a time-varying, quantifiable vestibular stimulus. Vestibular-sensitive synapses faithfully reported direction and velocity, rather than position or acceleration of whole-body motion, via bidirectional modulation of EPSC frequency. The lack of short-term synaptic dynamics ensured a highly linear relationship between velocity and charge transfer, and as few as 100 synapses provided resolution approaching psychophysical limits. This indicates that highly accurate stimulus representation can be achieved by small networks and even within single neurons.},

	Abstract = {To what extent does what we consciously see depend on where we attend to? Psychologists have long stressed the tight relationship between visual awareness and spatial attention at the behavioral level. However, the amount of overlap between their neural correlates remains a matter of debate. We recorded magnetoencephalographic signals while human subjects attended toward or away from faint stimuli that were reported as consciously seen only half of the time. Visually identical stimuli could thus be attended or not and consciously seen or not. Although attended stimuli were consciously seen slightly more often than unattended ones, the factorial analysis of stimulus-induced oscillatory brain activity revealed distinct and independent neural correlates of visual awareness and spatial attention at different frequencies in the gamma range (30-150 Hz). Whether attended or not, consciously seen stimuli induced increased mid-frequency gamma-band activity over the contralateral visual cortex, whereas spatial attention modulated high-frequency gamma-band activity in response to both consciously seen and unseen stimuli. A parametric analysis of the data at the single-trial level confirmed that the awareness-related mid-frequency activity drove the seen-unseen decision but also revealed a small influence of the attention-related high-frequency activity on the decision. These results suggest that subjective visual experience is shaped by the cumulative contribution of two processes operating independently at the neural level, one reflecting visual awareness per se and the other reflecting spatial attention.},

	Abstract = {The responses of neurons in lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) exhibit powerful suppressive phenomena such as contrast saturation, size tuning, and masking. These phenomena cannot be explained by the classical center-surround receptive field and have been ascribed to a variety of mechanisms, including feedback from cortex. We asked whether these phenomena might all be explained by a single mechanism, contrast gain control, which is inherited from retina and possibly strengthened in thalamus. We formalized an intuitive model of retinal contrast gain control that explicitly predicts gain as a function of local contrast. In the model, the output of the receptive field is divided by the output of a suppressive field, which computes the local root-mean-square contrast. The model provides good fits to LGN responses to a variety of stimuli; with a single set of parameters, it captures saturation, size tuning, and masking. It also correctly predicts that responses to small stimuli grow proportionally with contrast: were it not for the suppressive field, LGN responses would be linear. We characterized the suppressive field and found that it is similar in size to the surround of the classical receptive field (which is eight times larger than commonly estimated), it is not selective for stimulus orientation, and it responds to a wide range of frequencies, including very low spatial frequencies and high temporal frequencies. The latter property is hardly consistent with feedback from cortex. These measurements thoroughly describe the visual properties of contrast gain control in LGN and provide a parsimonious explanation for disparate suppressive phenomena.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Integrating information from the different senses markedly enhances the detection and identification of external stimuli. Compared with unimodal inputs, semantically and/or spatially congruent multisensory cues speed discrimination and improve reaction times. Discordant inputs have the opposite effect, reducing performance and slowing responses. These behavioural features of crossmodal processing appear to have parallels in the response properties of multisensory cells in the superior colliculi and cerebral cortex of non-human mammals. Although spatially concordant multisensory inputs can produce a dramatic, often multiplicative, increase in cellular activity, spatially disparate cues tend to induce a profound response depression. RESULTS: Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we investigated whether similar indices of crossmodal integration are detectable in human cerebral cortex, and for the synthesis of complex inputs relating to stimulus identity. Ten human subjects were exposed to varying epochs of semantically congruent and incongruent audio-visual speech and to each modality in isolation. Brain activations to matched and mismatched audio-visual inputs were contrasted with the combined response to both unimodal conditions. This strategy identified an area of heteromodal cortex in the left superior temporal sulcus that exhibited significant supra-additive response enhancement to matched audio-visual inputs and a corresponding sub-additive response to mismatched inputs. CONCLUSIONS: The data provide fMRI evidence of crossmodal binding by convergence in the human heteromodal cortex. They further suggest that response enhancement and depression may be a general property of multisensory integration operating at different levels of the neuroaxis and irrespective of the purpose for which sensory inputs are combined.},

	Abstract = {Whisker movement is somatotopically represented in rodent neocortex by electrical activity in clearly defined barrels, which can be visualized in living brain slices. The functional architecture of this part of the cortex can thus be mapped in vitro with respect to its physiological input and compared with its anatomical architecture. The spatial extent of excitation was measured at high temporal resolution by imaging optical signals from voltage-sensitive dye evoked by stimulation of individual barrels in layer 4. The optical signals correlated closely with subthreshold EPSPs recorded simultaneously from excitatory neurons in layer 4 and layer 2/3, respectively. Excitation was initially (<2 msec) limited to the stimulated barrel and subsequently (>3 msec) spread in a columnar manner into layer 2/3 and then subsided in both layers after approximately 50 msec. The lateral extent of the response was limited to the cortical column defined structurally by the barrel in layer 4. Two experimental interventions increased the spread of excitation. First, blocking GABA(A) receptor-mediated synaptic inhibition caused excitation to spread laterally throughout wide regions of layer 2/3 and layer 5 but not into neighboring barrels, suggesting that the local excitatory connections within layer 4 are restricted to single barrels and that inhibitory neurons control spread in supragranular and infragranular layers. Second, NMDA receptor-dependent increase of the spread of excitation was induced by pairing repetitive stimulation of a barrel column with coincident stimulation of layer 2/3 in a neighboring column. Such plasticity in the spatial extent of excitation in a barrel column could underlie changes in cortical map structure induced by alterations of sensory experience.},

@article{takahashi2007a,
	Abstract = {Recent studies have shown that most neurons in the dorsal medial superior temporal area (MSTd) signal the direction of self-translation (i.e., heading) in response to both optic flow and inertial motion. Much less is currently known about the response properties of MSTd neurons during self-rotation. We have characterized the three-dimensional tuning of MSTd neurons while monkeys passively fixated a central, head-fixed target. Rotational stimuli were either presented using a motion platform or simulated visually using optic flow. Nearly all MSTd cells were significantly tuned for the direction of rotation in the absence of optic flow, with more neurons preferring roll than pitch or yaw rotations. The preferred rotation axis in response to optic flow was generally the opposite of that during physical rotation. This result differs sharply from our findings for translational motion, where approximately half of MSTd neurons have congruent visual and vestibular preferences. By testing a subset of neurons with combined visual and vestibular stimulation, we also show that the contributions of visual and vestibular cues to MSTd responses depend on the relative reliabilities of the two stimulus modalities. Previous studies of MSTd responses to motion in darkness have assumed a vestibular origin for the activity observed. We have directly verified this assumption by recording from MSTd neurons after bilateral labyrinthectomy. Selectivity for physical rotation and translation stimuli was eliminated after labyrinthectomy, whereas selectivity to optic flow was unaffected. Overall, the lack of MSTd neurons with congruent rotation tuning for visual and vestibular stimuli suggests that MSTd does not integrate these signals to produce a robust perception of self-rotation. Vestibular rotation signals in MSTd may instead be used to compensate for the confounding effects of rotatory head movements on optic flow.},

@article{derdikman2003a,
	Abstract = {Sensory processing and its perception require that local information would also be available globally. Indeed, in the mammalian neocortex, local excitation spreads over large distances via the long-range horizontal connections in layer 2/3 and may spread over an entire cortical area if excitatory polysynaptic pathways are also activated. Therefore, a balance between local excitation and surround inhibition is required. Here we explore the spatiotemporal aspects of cortical depolarization and hyperpolarization of rats anesthetized with urethane. New voltage-sensitive dyes (VSDs) were used for high-resolution real-time visualization of the cortical responses to whisker deflections and cutaneous stimulations of the whisker pad. These advances facilitated imaging of ongoing activity and evoked responses even without signal averaging. We found that the motion of a single whisker evoked a cortical response exhibiting either one or three phases. During a triphasic response, there was first a cortical depolarization in a small cortical region the size of a single cortical barrel. Subsequently, this depolarization increased and spread laterally in an oval manner, preferentially along rows of the barrel field. During the second phase, the amplitude of the evoked response declined rapidly, presumably because of recurrent inhibition. Subsequently, the third phase exhibiting a depolarization rebound was observed and clear, and approximately 16 Hz oscillations were detected. Stimulus conditions revealing a net surround hyperpolarization during the second phase were also found. By using new, improved VSD, the present findings shed new light on the spatial parameters of the intricate spatiotemporal cortical interplay of inhibition and excitation.},

@article{golding2002a,
	Abstract = {Strengthening of synaptic connections following coincident pre- and postsynaptic activity was proposed by Hebb as a cellular mechanism for learning. Contemporary models assume that multiple synapses must act cooperatively to induce the postsynaptic activity required for hebbian synaptic plasticity. One mechanism for the implementation of this cooperation is action potential firing, which begins in the axon, but which can influence synaptic potentiation following active backpropagation into dendrites. Backpropagation is limited, however, and action potentials often fail to invade the most distal dendrites. Here we show that long-term potentiation of synapses on the distal dendrites of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons does require cooperative synaptic inputs, but does not require axonal action potential firing and backpropagation. Rather, locally generated and spatially restricted regenerative potentials (dendritic spikes) contribute to the postsynaptic depolarization and calcium entry necessary to trigger potentiation of distal synapses. We find that this mechanism can also function at proximal synapses, suggesting that dendritic spikes participate generally in a form of synaptic potentiation that does not require postsynaptic action potential firing in the axon.},

	Abstract = {1. Spatial summation within cat retinal receptive fields was studied by recording from optic-tract fibres the responses of ganglion cells to grating patterns whose luminance perpendicular to the bars varied sinusoidally about the mean level. 2. Summation over the receptive fields of some cells (X-cells) was found to be approximately linear, while for other cells (Y-cells) summation was very non-linear. 3. The mean discharge frequency of Y-cells (unlike that of X-cells) was greatly increased when grating patterns drifted across their receptive fields. 4. In twenty-one X-cells the relation between the contrast and spatial frequency of drifting sinusoidal gratings which evoked the same small response was measured. In every case it was found that the reciprocal of this relation, the contrast sensitivity function, could be satisfactorily described by the difference of two Gaussian functions. 5. This finding supports the hypothesis that the sensitivities of the antagonistic centre and surround summating regions of ganglion cell receptive fields fall off as Gaussian functions of the distance from the field centre. 6. The way in which the sensitivity of an X-cell for a contrast-edge pattern varied with the distance of the edge from the receptive field centre was determined and found to be consistent with the cell's measured contrast sensitivity function. 7. Reducing the retinal illumination produced changes in the contrast sensitivity function of an X-cell which suggested that the diameters of the summating regions of the receptive field increased while the surround region became relatively ineffective.},

	Abstract = {In order to study the relative perceptual availability of global and local features in very sparse patterns, subjects were asked to make 'same'/'different' judgments on pairs of geometrical figures and the times needed to detect global and local differences were compared. With triangular patterns a global precedence was found which could be attributed to size differences. With rectangular patterns global precedence was larger, not accounted for by size differences, and indifferent both to the number of elements and to their spacing. Thus it was demonstrated that global precedence may hold for patterns with as few as four elements. Patterns with smooth edges could be compared much more quickly than patterns with serrated eges. It is proposed that configurational properties of some of the patterns interfered with the encoding of their global structures or with comparing them. It is argued that the results support a principle of global addressability which postulates that visual schemata are mainly addressed through their global constituents.},

	Abstract = {In this study, we investigate the ability of the mammalian auditory pathway to adapt its strategy for temporal processing under natural stimulus conditions. We derive temporal receptive fields from the responses of neurons in the inferior colliculus to vocalization stimuli with and without additional ambient noise. We find that the onset of ambient noise evokes a change in receptive field dynamics that corresponds to a change from bandpass to lowpass temporal filtering. We show that these changes occur within a few hundred milliseconds of the onset of the noise and are evident across a range of overall stimulus intensities. Using a simple model, we illustrate how these changes in temporal processing exploit differences in the statistical properties of vocalizations and ambient noises to increase the information in the neural response in a manner consistent with the principles of efficient coding.},

	Abstract = {Studies examining memories of arousing 'real-life' events show that emotion heightens the feeling of remembering, without necessarily enhancing the objective accuracy of the memories. We measured brain activity associated with the feeling of remembering emotional and neutral photos. Subjects indicated whether recognition was accompanied by a recollection of details about the study episode ('remember') or not ('know'). 'Remember' judgments were boosted for emotional photos, but accuracy did not differ. For neutral photos, 'remember' judgments were related to enhanced activity in the parahippocampal cortex, previously related to recognition of visual details, which one might expect to supply the retrieval clues for a 'remember' judgment. In contrast, 'remember' judgments for emotional photos were associated with enhanced activity in the amygdala, suggesting that subjects rely on arousal and perceptual fluency to evaluate these memories. For the first time, we identify the neural mechanisms underlying the enhanced feeling of remembering for emotional events.},

	Abstract = {Spatial processing was assessed following implantation of subdural electrodes in the nondominant hemisphere with electrocortical stimulation mapping (ESM) in two patients before epilepsy surgery. The first patient had mild hemispatial neglect/extinction during ESM of posterior temporal and inferior parietal areas. These areas were resected, and the patient had postoperative deficits that were similar to those occurring with ESM. The second patient was found to have marked hemispatial neglect during stimulation of parietal areas. These areas were not resected, and the patient had no neglect following surgery. These results suggest that ESM can help predict spatial processing deficits associated with cortical resection, and may help prevent postoperative impairments following resection in right parietal or temporal regions.},

	Abstract = {Neuronal receptive fields (RFs) play crucial roles in visual processing. While the linear RFs of early neurons have been well studied, RFs of cortical complex cells are nonlinear and therefore difficult to characterize, especially in the context of natural stimuli. In this study, we used a nonlinear technique to compute the RFs of complex cells from their responses to natural images. We found that each RF is well described by a small number of subunits, which are oriented, localized, and bandpass. These subunits contribute to neuronal responses in a contrast-dependent, polarity-invariant manner, and they can largely predict the orientation and spatial frequency tuning of the cell. Although the RF structures measured with natural images were similar to those measured with random stimuli, natural images were more effective for driving complex cells, thus facilitating rapid identification of the subunits. The subunit RF model provides a useful basis for understanding cortical processing of natural stimuli.},

	Abstract = {Neuronal interactions between primary and secondary visual cortical areas are important for visual processing, but the spatiotemporal patterns of the interaction are not well understood. We used voltage-sensitive dye imaging to visualize neuronal activity in rat visual cortex and found visually evoked waves propagating from V1 to other visual areas. A primary wave originated in the monocular area of V1 and was "compressed" when propagating to V2. A reflected wave initiated after compression and propagated backward into V1. The compression occurred at the V1/V2 border, and local GABAA inhibition is important for the compression. The compression/reflection pattern provides a two-phase modulation: V1 is first depolarized by the primary wave, and then V1 and V2 are simultaneously depolarized by the reflected and primary waves, respectively. The compression/reflection pattern only occurred for evoked waves and not for spontaneous waves, suggesting that it is organized by an internal mechanism associated with visual processing.},

	Abstract = {Humans select relevant locations in a scene by means of stimulus-driven bottom-up and context-dependent top-down mechanisms. These have mainly been investigated by recording eye movements under 2D natural or 3D artificial stimulation conditions. Here we try to close that obvious gap and presented 2D and 3D versions of natural, pink, and white noise images to human subjects. Importantly, ground truth distance was obtained for all image pairs by laser scanning. Recording eye movements, we investigated the influence of disparity information and of higher order scene correlations on basic saccade properties and on saliency of bottom-up information. Our results show that the removal of higher order correlations changed saccadic rate, length and main sequence, and the subjects' explorative behavior. Introduction of disparity information countered these effects and alleviated differences between image categories. Disparity information had no effect on the saliency of monocular image features like luminance and texture contrast; however, without higher order correlations these features were uncorrelated to fixation locations. An analysis of binocular image features revealed that participants fixated closer locations earlier than more distant locations. Importantly, this also held for 2D natural images. Taken together, we conclude that depth information changes basic eye movement properties and provides a salient image feature.},

	Abstract = {Feedforward connections are thought to be important in the generation of orientation-selective responses in visual cortex by establishing a bias in the sampling of information from regions of visual space that lie along a neuron's axis of preferred orientation. It remains unclear, however, which structural elements-dendrites or axons-are ultimately responsible for conveying this sampling bias. To explore this question, we have examined the spatial arrangement of feedforward axonal connections that link non-oriented neurons in layer 4 and orientation-selective neurons in layer 2/3 of visual cortex in the tree shrew. Target sites of labeled boutons in layer 2/3 resulting from focal injections of biocytin in layer 4 show an orientation-specific axial bias that is sufficient to confer orientation tuning to layer 2/3 neurons. We conclude that the anisotropic arrangement of axon terminals is the principal source of the orientation bias contributed by feedforward connections.},

	Abstract = {We recorded over 90,000 saccades while observers viewed a diverse collection of natural images and measured low level visual features at fixation. The features that discriminated between where observers fixated and where they did not varied considerably with task, and the length of the preceding saccade. Short saccades (<8 degrees) are image feature dependent, long are less so. For free viewing, short saccades target high frequency information, long saccades are scale-invariant. When searching for luminance targets, saccades of all lengths are scale-invariant. We argue that models of saccade behaviour must account not only for task but also for saccade length and that long and short saccades are targeted differently.},

	Abstract = {The salience map is a crucial concept for many theories of visual attention. On this map, each object in the scene competes for selection - the more conspicuous the object, the greater its representation, and the more likely it will be chosen. In recent years, the firing patterns of single neurons have been interpreted using this framework. Here, we review evidence showing that the expression of salience is remarkably similar across structures, remarkably different across tasks, and modified in important ways when the salient object is consistent with the goals of the participant. These observations have important ramifications for theories of attention. We conclude that priority--the combined representation of salience and relevance--best describes the firing properties of neurons.},

Test lines could be either bright or dark. Detection thresholds were obtained through a temporal two-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) procedure with the method of constant stimuli. When target and inducer had equal contrast polarity, low thresholds of target lines were observed for low inducer contrasts and increased with increasing inducer contrast. With opposite contrast polarity of target and inducer, thresholds were high for low inducer contrasts and decreased for increasing contrast thereof. Our results support the hypothesis that cortical mechanisms with different sensitivity to the sign and strength of contrast participate in the detection facilitation of line contours.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The main obstacle in interpreting EEG/MEG data in terms of brain connectivity is the fact that because of volume conduction, the activity of a single brain source can be observed in many channels. Here, we present an approach which is insensitive to false connectivity arising from volume conduction. METHODS: We show that the (complex) coherency of non-interacting sources is necessarily real and, hence, the imaginary part of coherency provides an excellent candidate to study brain interactions. Although the usual magnitude and phase of coherency contain the same information as the real and imaginary parts, we argue that the Cartesian representation is far superior for studying brain interactions. The method is demonstrated for EEG measurements of voluntary finger movement. RESULTS: We found: (a) from 5 s before to movement onset a relatively weak interaction around 20 Hz between left and right motor areas where the contralateral side leads the ipsilateral side; and (b) approximately 2-4 s after movement, a stronger interaction also at 20 Hz in the opposite direction. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to reliably detect brain interaction during movement from EEG data. SIGNIFICANCE: The method allows unambiguous detection of brain interaction from rhythmic EEG/MEG data.},

@article{reid1992a,
	Abstract = {We have studied the responses of striate cortical neurons to stimuli whose contrast is modulated in time by either a single sinusoid or by the sum of eight sinusoids. The sum-of-sinusoids stimulus resembles white noise and has been used to study the linear and nonlinear dynamics of retinal ganglion cells (Victor et al., 1977). In cortical neurons, we have found different linear and second-order responses to single-sinusoid and sum-of-sinusoids inputs. Specifically, while the responsivity near the optimal temporal frequency is lower for the sum-of-sinusoids stimulus, the responsivity at higher temporal frequencies is relatively greater. Along with this change in the response amplitudes, there is a systematic change in the time course of responses. For complex cells, the integration time, the effective delay due to a combination of actual delays and low-pass filter stages, changes from a median of 85 ms with single sinusoids to 57 ms with a sum of sinusoids. For simple cells, the integration times for single sinusoids range from 44-100 ms, but cluster tightly around 40 ms for the sum-of-sinusoids stimulus. The change in time constant would argue that the increased sensitivity to high frequencies cannot be explained by a static threshold, but must be caused by a fundamental alteration in the response dynamics. These effects are not seen in the retina (Shapley {\&} Victor, 1981) and are most likely cortical in origin.},

	Abstract = {Graves' disease is a common condition encountered in clinical practice. The available modes of therapy for Graves' disease are antithyroid drugs, radioiodine and surgery. Radioiodine therapy is indicated in patients with nearly all causes of hyperthyroidism and is considered the treatment of choice for most patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism who are beyond the adolescent years. Pregnancy and breast-feeding are absolute contraindications. Although there are many ways of calculating the dose of radioiodine, fixed dose regimens are gaining acceptance. Hypothyroidism follows sooner or later in nearly all patients treated with radioiodine. Available evidence suggest that patients are best treated by a single thyroablative dose, the aim being elimination of hyperthyroidism, with larger doses accomplishing it with more certainty, and the inevitable hypothyroidism develops under physician control. Radioiodine therapy can lead to exacerbation of infiltrative ophthalmopathy and this can be prevented by the concomitant administration of corticosteroids. Radioiodine therapy for Graves' hyperthyroidism has no adverse effects on the health of the offspring of treated patients. There are no definitive data that provide evidence for increased rates of thyroid cancer, leukaemia, infertility or neonatal abnormality in patients treated with radioiodine. Radioiodine therapy is safe, definitive and cost-effective.},

	Abstract = {Color appearance remains remarkably stable in the aging visual system despite large changes in the spectral distribution of the retinal stimulus and losses in chromatic sensitivity (P. B. Delahunt, J. L. Hardy, K. Okajima, {\&} J. S. Werner, 2005; J. S. Werner, 1996). This stability could reflect adaptive adjustments in peripheral or central chromatic mechanisms that compensate for sensitivity losses in senescence. We asked whether similar compensatory adjustments play a role in maintaining spatial vision--and whether the adaptation itself shows changes with aging-by examining the effects of adaptation on judgments of image focus. Perceptual aftereffects following adaptation to a uniform field and blurred or sharpened images were compared between younger adults and older observers. Subjects adapted to a sequence of blurred or sharpened images for 120 s, and a two-alternative forced-choice staircase task was used to vary the filter exponent of the test to define the subjective point of best focus. There was a small but significant difference between younger and older observers in the level perceived as best focused in all three adaptation conditions, possibly reflecting differences in the ambient blur level the groups are routinely exposed to. However, the magnitude of the blur aftereffect did not differ between the two age groups. These results suggest that although there may be small differences in the long-term adaptation to blur, younger and older observers do not differ in the strength of adaptation to transient changes in blur. The neural processes mediating adaptation to blur thus appear to remain largely intact with aging.},

	Abstract = {Nutrition and nutritional status can have profound effects on immune functions, resistance to infection and autoimmunity in man and other animals. Nutrients enhance or depress immune function depending on the nutrient and level of its intake. Protein-energy malnutrition and vitamin A deficiency are strongly associated with impaired immunity and infectious disease. The essential role vitamin A plays in infection and maintenance of mucosal surfaces has long been known. Recent evidence shows that T-cell subpopulations, cytokines and antibody subclasses are all affected by vitamin A. In animal studies supplementation with vitamin E protects against infection and is linked to stimulatory effects on the immune system. In man vitamin E and other anti-oxidants increase the number of CD4+ cells. Dietary lipids and zinc have a substantial impact on autoimmunity from protective to potentiation of immuno-pathological processes in animals. There is considerable potential to modify human autoimmune disease by manipulation of lipid nutrition. Deficiency of pyridoxine induces atrophy of lymphoid organs, marked reduction in lymphocyte numbers, impairs antibody responses and IL-2 production. Dietary copper is important in the prevention of infection in some animal species and T-cell function is defective under deficiency states due to an inability to produce IL-2. Selenium has been linked to viral infection, enhanced T-cell functions and TNF beta induced increase in natural killer cell activity. Understanding the molecular and cellular immunological mechanisms involved in nutrient-immune interactions will increase our applications for nutrition of the immune system in health and in disease},

	Abstract = {A fundamental problem in biological and machine vision is visual invariance: How are objects perceived to be the same despite transformations such as translations, rotations, and scaling? In this letter, we describe a new, unsupervised approach to learning invariances based on Lie group theory. Unlike traditional approaches that sacrifice information about transformations to achieve invariance, the Lie group approach explicitly models the effects of transformations in images. As a result, estimates of transformations are available for other purposes, such as pose estimation and visuomotor control. Previous approaches based on first-order Taylor series expansions of images can be regarded as special cases of the Lie group approach, which utilizes a matrix-exponential-based generative model of images and can handle arbitrarily large transformations. We present an unsupervised expectation-maximization algorithm for learning Lie transformation operators directly from image data containing examples of transformations. Our experimental results show that the Lie operators learned by the algorithm from an artificial data set containing six types of affine transformations closely match the analytically predicted affine operators. We then demonstrate that the algorithm can also recover novel transformation operators from natural image sequences. We conclude by showing that the learned operators can be used to both generate and estimate transformations in images, thereby providing a basis for achieving visual invariance.},

	Abstract = {The mammalian cortex is organized in a columnar fashion: neurons lying below each other from the pia to the white matter usually share many functional properties. Across the cortical surface, cells with similar response properties are also clustered together, forming elongated bands or patches. Some response properties, such as orientation preference in the visual cortex, change gradually across the cortical surface forming 'orientation maps'. To determine the precise layout of iso-orientation domains, knowledge of responses not only to one but to many stimulus orientations is essential. Therefore, the exact depiction of orientation maps has been hampered by technical difficulties and remained controversial for almost thirty years. Here we use in vivo optical imaging based on intrinsic signals to gather information on the responses of a piece of cortex to gratings in many different orientations. This complete set of responses then provides detailed information on the structure of the orientation map in a large patch of cortex from area 18 of the cat. We find that cortical regions that respond best to one orientation form highly ordered patches rather than elongated bands. These iso-orientation patches are organized around 'orientation centres', producing pinwheel-like patterns in which the orientation preference of cells is changing continuously across the cortex. We have also analysed our data for fast changes in orientation preference and find that these 'fractures' are limited to the orientation centres. The pinwheels and orientation centres are such a prominent organizational feature that it should be important to understand their development as well as their function in the processing of visual information.},

We therefore used two-photon population calcium imaging in awake and subsequently anesthetized rats to follow action potential firing in populations of neurons across brain states, and examined how single neurons contributed to population activity. Firing rates and spike bursting in awake rats were higher, and pair-wise correlations were lower, compared with anesthetized rats. Anesthesia modulated population-wide synchronization and the relationship between firing rate and correlation. Overall, brain activity during wakefulness cannot be inferred using anesthesia.},

	Abstract = {Music consists of sound sequences that require integration over time. As we become familiar with music, associations between notes, melodies, and entire symphonic movements become stronger and more complex. These associations can become so tight that, for example, hearing the end of one album track can elicit a robust image of the upcoming track while anticipating it in total silence. Here, we study this predictive "anticipatory imagery" at various stages throughout learning and investigate activity changes in corresponding neural structures using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Anticipatory imagery (in silence) for highly familiar naturalistic music was accompanied by pronounced activity in rostral prefrontal cortex (PFC) and premotor areas. Examining changes in the neural bases of anticipatory imagery during two stages of learning conditional associations between simple melodies, however, demonstrates the importance of fronto-striatal connections, consistent with a role of the basal ganglia in "training" frontal cortex (Pasupathy and Miller, 2005). Another striking change in neural resources during learning was a shift between caudal PFC earlier to rostral PFC later in learning. Our findings regarding musical anticipation and sound sequence learning are highly compatible with studies of motor sequence learning, suggesting common predictive mechanisms in both domains.},

	Abstract = {Thyroid function disorders are common with a female to male ratio of 4 to 1. In adult women primary hypothyroidism and thyrotoxicosis have a prevalence of 3.5/1000 and 0.8/1000, respectively. This guideline is aimed at secondary care providers especially internists, but also contains relevant information for interested general practitioners and gynaecologists. A multidisciplinary working group, containing delegates of professional and patient organisations, prepared the guideline. According to principles of 'evidence-based medicine' available literature was studied and discussed. Considering the availability and quality of published studies a practical advice was formulated. For a full overview of the literature and considerations the reader is referred to the original version of the guideline (accessible through NIV-net). In this manuscript we have aimed to provide the practicing internist with practical and 'as evidence-based as possible' treatment guidelines with respect to thyroid function disorders.},

	Abstract = {The question of how the human brain represents conceptual knowledge has been debated in many scientific fields. Brain imaging studies have shown that different spatial patterns of neural activation are associated with thinking about different semantic categories of pictures and words (for example, tools, buildings, and animals). We present a computational model that predicts the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) neural activation associated with words for which fMRI data are not yet available. This model is trained with a combination of data from a trillion-word text corpus and observed fMRI data associated with viewing several dozen concrete nouns. Once trained, the model predicts fMRI activation for thousands of other concrete nouns in the text corpus, with highly significant accuracies over the 60 nouns for which we currently have fMRI data.},

	Abstract = {Many studies have demonstrated that the primary visual cortex contains multiple functional maps of visual properties (e.g., ocular dominance, orientation preference, and spatial-frequency preference), but as yet no consistent picture has emerged as to how these maps are related to one another. Three divergent, prior optical-imaging studies of spatial frequency are reanalyzed and critiqued in this article. Evidence is presented that a nonstimulus-specific response biased the interpretation of results in previous studies. In addition to reexamining four prior cat experiments, we carried out one new experiment. Through the use of different methods and a careful removal of the nonspecific response, we are led in all instances to a unique view of cortical organization for spatial-frequency preference. In particular, we find little apparent evidence for a columnar organization for spatial frequency. The response recorded by each image pixel may be viewed as arising from an admixture of low- and high-spatial-frequency populations. For most pixels, the ratio of these populations is 1:1.},

	Abstract = {The eye functions effectively over an enormous range of ambient illumination, because retinal sensitivity can be adapted to prevailing light levels. Higher order neurones in the visual pathway are presumably more concerned with relative changes in illumination, that is, contrast, because a great deal of information concerning absolute light level is processed at the retinal level. It would therefore be of considerable functional value if cells in the visual cortex could adapt their response levels to a steady-state ambient contrast, in a manner analogous to the sensitivity control mechanism of the retina. We have examined here the idea that adaptation of neurones in the visual cortex to ambient contrast is similar to adaptation in the retina to ambient illumination. The experiments were performed by measuring contrast response functions (response amplitude as a function of contrast) of striate neurones, while systematically adapting them to different contrast levels. Our results show that, for the majority of cortical neurones, response-contrast curves are laterally shifted along a log-contrast axis so that the effective domains of neurones are adjusted to match prevailing contrast levels. This contrast gain control mechanism, which was not observed for lateral geniculate (LGN) fibres, must be of prime importance to visual function.},

	Abstract = {The origin of orientation selectivity in the responses of simple cells in cat visual cortex serves as a model problem for understanding cortical circuitry and computation. The feed-forward model posits that this selectivity arises simply from the arrangement of thalamic inputs to a simple cell. Much evidence, including a number of recent intracellular studies, supports a primary role of the thalamic inputs in determining simple cell response properties, including orientation tuning. This mechanism alone, however, cannot explain the invariance of orientation tuning to changes in stimulus contrast. Simple cells receive push-pull inhibition: ON inhibition in OFF subregions and vice versa. Addition of such inhibition to the feed-forward model can account for this contrast invariance, provided the inhibition is sufficiently strong. The predictions of "normalization" and "feedback" models are reviewed and compared with the predictions of this modified feed-forward model and with experimental results. The modified feed-forward and the feedback models ascribe fundamentally different functions to cortical processing.},

	Abstract = {Humans have many cognitive skills not possessed by their nearest primate relatives. The cultural intelligence hypothesis argues that this is mainly due to a species-specific set of social-cognitive skills, emerging early in ontogeny, for participating and exchanging knowledge in cultural groups. We tested this hypothesis by giving a comprehensive battery of cognitive tests to large numbers of two of humans' closest primate relatives, chimpanzees and orangutans, as well as to 2.5-year-old human children before literacy and schooling. Supporting the cultural intelligence hypothesis and contradicting the hypothesis that humans simply have more "general intelligence," we found that the children and chimpanzees had very similar cognitive skills for dealing with the physical world but that the children had more sophisticated cognitive skills than either of the ape species for dealing with the social world.},

	Abstract = {To examine whether healthy individuals spontaneously direct attention to emotional pictures, eye movements were monitored continuously during the presentation of pairs of emotional and neutral pictures. A right hemisphere advantage was expected for initial orienting to emotional pictures. When an emotionally arousing picture was presented in the left visual hemifield, i.e., to the right hemisphere, the initial saccade was more often issued towards it, irrespective of valence. Negative pictures did not lead to avoidance throughout the 8-second trials; rather, both positive and negative valence held attention. This study adds to the evidence that overt attention to visual stimuli is boosted by emotion and that there is a right hemisphere advantage for orienting to emotional cues.},

@article{dio2007a,
	Abstract = {Is there an objective, biological basis for the experience of beauty in art? Or is aesthetic experience entirely subjective? Using fMRI technique, we addressed this question by presenting viewers, naive to art criticism, with images of masterpieces of Classical and Renaissance sculpture. Employing proportion as the independent variable, we produced two sets of stimuli: one composed of images of original sculptures; the other of a modified version of the same images. The stimuli were presented in three conditions: observation, aesthetic judgment, and proportion judgment. In the observation condition, the viewers were required to observe the images with the same mind-set as if they were in a museum. In the other two conditions they were required to give an aesthetic or proportion judgment on the same images. Two types of analyses were carried out: one which contrasted brain response to the canonical and the modified sculptures, and one which contrasted beautiful vs. ugly sculptures as judged by each volunteer. The most striking result was that the observation of original sculptures, relative to the modified ones, produced activation of the right insula as well as of some lateral and medial cortical areas (lateral occipital gyrus, precuneus and prefrontal areas). The activation of the insula was particularly strong during the observation condition. Most interestingly, when volunteers were required to give an overt aesthetic judgment, the images judged as beautiful selectively activated the right amygdala, relative to those judged as ugly. We conclude that, in observers naive to art criticism, the sense of beauty is mediated by two non-mutually exclusive processes: one based on a joint activation of sets of cortical neurons, triggered by parameters intrinsic to the stimuli, and the insula (objective beauty); the other based on the activation of the amygdala, driven by one's own emotional experiences (subjective beauty).},

	Abstract = {The significance of Behaviourism is examined in relation to its far conceptual roots, i.e. comparative animal studies initiated by Darwin, mechanistic physiological thinking initiated by Descartes and empiricist associationism. The Behaviourist anti-mentalist position induced neuromechanistic interpretations based on Pavlovian reflexes, stimulus-response connectionism and the very first hypotheses on synaptic plasticity. As a result, the evolutionary tradition was dropped and the two other trends were combined into a new adaptive version of Cartesian automaton, with persisting influences in modern reductionist thinking, from robotics and cognitive science to the neuroscience of learning and memory.},

We show that the input/output relation of a sensory system in a dynamic environment changes with the statistical properties of the environment. Specifically, when the dynamic range of inputs changes, the input/output relation rescales so as to match the dynamic range of responses to that of the inputs. We give direct evidence that the scaling of the input/output relation is set to maximize information transmission for each distribution of signals. This adaptive behavior should be particularly useful in dealing with the intermittent statistics of natural signals.},

	Annote = {first, by using fly's motion sensitive H1 neurons they investigate how these neurons adapts to the std of the input distribution. It is shown that neurons do not code the input signal with a fixed rule but adapt their firing rates by stretching or compressing their sensitivity to the distribution of the input so that when a slowly or fast varying signals are processed equally well even though the dynamic range they span is very different. second they use reverse Covariance method to estimate the RF of these neurons. They found that 2 kernels, one responsive to velocity and second to the acceleration of the signals describe well the RF. They finally proove that the stretching factor that is used by the neurons is the one which optimizes the information rate transmitted by the neuron.},

	Abstract = {When different perceptual signals of the same physical property are integrated, for example, an objects' size, which can be seen and felt, they form a more reliable sensory estimate (e.g., M. O. Ernst {\&} M. S. Banks, 2002). This, however, implies that the sensory system already knows which signals belong together and how they relate. In other words, the system has to know the mapping between the signals. In a Bayesian model of cue integration, this prior knowledge can be made explicit. Here, we ask whether such a mapping between two arbitrary sensory signals from vision and touch can be learned from their statistical co-occurrence such that they become integrated. In the Bayesian framework, this means changing the belief about the distribution of the stimuli. To this end, we trained subjects with stimuli that are usually unrelated in the world--the luminance of an object (visual signal) and its stiffness (haptic signal). In the training phase, we then presented subjects with combinations of these two signals, which were artificially correlated, and thus, we introduced a new mapping between them. For example, the stiffer the object, the brighter it was. We measured the influence of learning by comparing discrimination performance before and after training. The prediction is that integration makes discrimination worse for stimuli, which are incongruent with the newly learned mapping, because integration would cause this incongruency to disappear perceptually. The more certain subjects are about the new mapping, the stronger should the influence be on discrimination performance. Thus, learning in this context is about acquiring beliefs. We found a significant change in discrimination performance before and after training when comparing trials with congruent and incongruent stimuli. After training, discrimination thresholds for the incongruent stimuli are increased relative to thresholds for congruent stimuli, suggesting that subjects learned effectively to integrate the two formerly unrelated signals.},

	Abstract = {Saccadic reaction time (SRT) toward a visual target stimulus was measured under simultaneous presentation of an auditory non-target (accessory stimulus). Horizontal position of the target was varied (25 degrees left and right of fixation) as well as position and intensity of the auditory accessory. SRT was reduced under the presence of the accessory, and it decreased both with increasing intensity of the auditory accessory and with decreasing distance between target and accessory. The absence of a significant interaction between distance and auditory intensity suggests (1) that the intensity of the accessory stimulus has no direct influence on the process of crossmodal integration, and (2) that spatial position and intensity of the accessory are processed in separate stages. This was supported by a probability inequality test showing that the amount of neural coactivation depends on spatial distance but not on auditory intensity. The results are discussed in the framework of a two-stage model assuming separate processing of unimodal and bimodal characteristics of the stimuli. These results are related to several recent neurophysiological findings.},

One way to guide the search for models is to use a general nonparametric regression algorithm, such as a neural network. We have developed a multilayer feed-forward network algorithm that can be used to characterize nonlinear stimulus-response mapping functions of neurons in primary visual cortex (area V1) using natural image stimuli. The network is capable of extracting several known V1 response properties such as: orientation and spatial frequency tuning, the spatial phase invariance of complex cells, and direction selectivity. We present details of a method for training networks and visualizing their properties. We also compare how well conventional explicit models and those developed using neural networks can predict novel responses to natural scenes.},

	Abstract = {Although it is now well known that natural images display consistent statistical properties which distinguish them from random luminance distributions, this ecological approach to vision has so far concentrated on those second-order image statistics which are quantified by image power spectra, and it appears to be the image phase spectra which carry the majority of the image-intrinsic information. The present work describes how conventional nth-order statistics can be modified so that they are sensitive to image phase structure only. The modified measures are applied to an ensemble of natural images, and the results show that natural images do have consistent higher-order statistical properties which distinguish them from random-phase images with the same power spectra. An interpretation of this finding in terms of higher-order spectra suggests that these consistent properties arise from the ubiquity of edge structures in natural images, and raises the possibility that the properties of ideal relative-phase-sensitive mechanisms could be determined directly from analyses of the higher-order structure of natural scenes.},

	Annote = {this paper gives good hints on how to compute the third and fourth moments of natural images. it proposes a method to compute these moments. Computing these moments is prone to errors because of limited sample size and non-stationariness of the natural images due to the high power of low frequencies. nice introduction to higher order spectra is also given. in an whitened image, the second moment becomes a complete description of the second order statistics = the auto-correlation is zero everywhere except at zero lag (accordingly the power spectrum is flat everywhere). The kurtosis and skewness becomes than completely independent of the second order statistics (these have the second oder moments in their denominotor). The phase randomized images must have their third and fourth moments equal to zero. why? Because the distribution of luminances must be gaussian. why? I dont have a perfect answer yet but the sum of many random phase sine waves must somehow give a gaussian distribution. However if this is not the case this points to the problem of limited sample size. It could be that the image has non-stationary second and first order statistics due to the prevalence of the low-frequency power in natural images. This may of course create non-zero kurtoted and skewed distributions. (imaging 2 one dimensional gaussians with different mean and std which could result in asymmetric and kurtotic distributions). So the first and second order non-stationariness corrupt the 3rd and 4th moments. And the 4 moment becomes a measure of the variances of variances. (if you add histograms with close to zero variance distributions and some with large variances than you end up in a highly kurtotic distribution).},

	Abstract = {The massive visual input from the eye to the brain requires selective processing of some visual information at the expense of other information, a process referred to as visual attention. Increases in the responses of visual neurons with attention have been extensively studied along the visual processing streams in monkey cerebral cortex, from primary visual areas to parietal and frontal cortex. Here we show, by recording neurons in attending macaque monkeys (Macaca mulatta), that attention modulates visual signals before they even reach cortex by increasing responses of both magnocellular and parvocellular neurons in the first relay between retina and cortex, the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). At the same time, attention decreases neuronal responses in the adjacent thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN). Crick argued for such modulation of the LGN by observing that it is inhibited by the TRN, and suggested that "if the thalamus is the gateway to the cortex, the reticular complex might be described as the guardian of the gateway", a reciprocal relationship we now show to be more than just hypothesis. The reciprocal modulation in LGN and TRN appears only during the initial visual response, but the modulation of LGN reappears later in the response, suggesting separate early and late sources of attentional modulation in LGN.},

	Abstract = {This work examines the computational architecture used by the brain during the analysis of the spectral envelope of sounds, an important acoustic feature for defining auditory objects. Dynamic causal modelling and Bayesian model selection were used to evaluate a family of 16 network models explaining functional magnetic resonance imaging responses in the right temporal lobe during spectral envelope analysis. The models encode different hypotheses about the effective connectivity between Heschl's Gyrus (HG), containing the primary auditory cortex, planum temporale (PT), and superior temporal sulcus (STS), and the modulation of that coupling during spectral envelope analysis. In particular, we aimed to determine whether information processing during spectral envelope analysis takes place in a serial or parallel fashion. The analysis provides strong support for a serial architecture with connections from HG to PT and from PT to STS and an increase of the HG to PT connection during spectral envelope analysis. The work supports a computational model of auditory object processing, based on the abstraction of spectro-temporal "templates" in the PT before further analysis of the abstracted form in anterior temporal lobe areas.},

	Abstract = {The rodent primary somatosensory cortex is spontaneously active in the form of locally synchronous membrane depolarizations (UP states) separated by quiescent hyperpolarized periods (DOWN states) both under anesthesia and during quiet wakefulness. In vivo whole-cell recordings and tetrode unit recordings were combined with voltage-sensitive dye imaging to analyze the relationship of the activity of individual pyramidal neurons in layer 2/3 to the ensemble spatiotemporal dynamics of the spontaneous depolarizations. These were either brief and localized to an area of a barrel column or occurred as propagating waves dependent on local glutamatergic synaptic transmission in layer 2/3. Spontaneous activity inhibited the sensory responses evoked by whisker deflection, accounting almost entirely for the large trial-to-trial variability of sensory-evoked postsynaptic potentials and action potentials. Subthreshold sensory synaptic responses evoked while a cortical area was spontaneously depolarized were smaller, briefer and spatially more confined. Surprisingly, whisker deflections evoked fewer action potentials during the spontaneous depolarizations despite neurons being closer to threshold. The ongoing spontaneous activity thus regulates the amplitude and the time-dependent spread of the sensory response in layer 2/3 barrel cortex.},

	Abstract = {One of the fundamental tasks of the visual cortex is to integrate input from different parts of the retina, parsing an image into contours and surfaces, and then assembling these features into coherent representations of objects. To examine the role of the primary visual cortex in the integration of visual information, we measured the response properties of neurons under different stimulus conditions. Surprisingly, we found that even the most conventional measures of receptive field (RF) size were not fixed, but could vary depending on stimulus contrast and foreground-background relationships. On average, the length of the excitatory RF was 4-fold greater for a low-contrast stimulus than for a stimulus at high contrast. Embedding a high-contrast stimulus in a textured background tended to suppress neuronal responses and produced an enlargement in RF size similar to that observed by decreasing the contrast of an isolated stimulus. The results show that RF dimensions are regulated in a dynamic manner that depends both on local stimulus characteristics, such as contrast, and on global relationships between a stimulus and its surroundings.},

	Abstract = {When natural scenes are viewed, a multitude of objects that are stable in their environments are brought in and out of view by eye movements. The posterior parietal cortex is crucial for the analysis of space, visual attention and movement. Neurons in one of its subdivisions, the lateral intraparietal area (LIP), have visual responses to stimuli appearing abruptly at particular retinal locations (their receptive fields). We have tested the responses of LIP neurons to stimuli that entered their receptive field by saccades. Neurons had little or no response to stimuli brought into their receptive field by saccades, unless the stimuli were behaviourally significant. We established behavioural significance in two ways: either by making a stable stimulus task-relevant, or by taking advantage of the attentional attraction of an abruptly appearing stimulus. Our results show that under ordinary circumstances the entire visual world is only weakly represented in LIP. The visual representation in LIP is sparse, with only the most salient or behaviourally relevant objects being strongly represented.},

	Abstract = {The entropy metric derived from information theory provides a means to quantify the amount of information transmitted in acoustic streams like speech or music. By systematically varying the entropy of pitch sequences, we sought brain areas where neural activity and energetic demands increase as a function of entropy. Such a relationship is predicted to occur in an efficient encoding mechanism that uses less computational resource when less information is present in the signal: we specifically tested the hypothesis that such a relationship is present in the planum temporale (PT). In two convergent functional MRI studies, we demonstrated this relationship in PT for encoding, while furthermore showing that a distributed fronto-parietal network for retrieval of acoustic information is independent of entropy. The results establish PT as an efficient neural engine that demands less computational resource to encode redundant signals than those with high information content.},

@article{koerding2004b,
	Abstract = {When we learn a new motor skill, such as playing an approaching tennis ball, both our sensors and the task possess variability. Our sensors provide imperfect information about the ball's velocity, so we can only estimate it. Combining information from multiple modalities can reduce the error in this estimate. On a longer time scale, not all velocities are a priori equally probable, and over the course of a match there will be a probability distribution of velocities. According to bayesian theory, an optimal estimate results from combining information about the distribution of velocities-the prior-with evidence from sensory feedback. As uncertainty increases, when playing in fog or at dusk, the system should increasingly rely on prior knowledge. To use a bayesian strategy, the brain would need to represent the prior distribution and the level of uncertainty in the sensory feedback. Here we control the statistical variations of a new sensorimotor task and manipulate the uncertainty of the sensory feedback. We show that subjects internally represent both the statistical distribution of the task and their sensory uncertainty, combining them in a manner consistent with a performance-optimizing bayesian process. The central nervous system therefore employs probabilistic models during sensorimotor learning.},

	Abstract = {In this study, we show robust nicotinic excitation of pyramidal neurons in layer VI of prefrontal cortex. This layer contains the corticothalamic neurons, which gate thalamic activity and play a critical role in attention. Our experiments tested nicotinic excitation across postnatal development, using whole-cell recordings in prefrontal brain slices from rats. These experiments showed that layer VI neurons have peak nicotinic currents during the first postnatal month, a time period of intensive cortical development in rodents. We demonstrate that these currents are mediated directly by postsynaptic nicotinic receptors and can be suppressed by a competitive antagonist of alpha(4)beta(2)* nicotinic receptors. To record from identified corticothalamic neurons, we performed stereotaxic surgery to label the neurons projecting to medial dorsal thalamus. As hypothesized, recordings from these retrogradely labeled neurons in layer VI showed prominent nicotinic currents. Finally, we examined the effects of the drug nicotine on layer VI neurons and probed for the potential involvement of the accessory subunit, alpha(5), in their receptors. A level of nicotine similar to that found in the blood of smokers elicits a stable inward current in layer VI neurons, yet this exposure desensitizes approximately 50% of the subsequent current elicited by acetylcholine. An allosteric modulator of alpha(4)beta(2)alpha(5) receptors resulted in a 2.5-fold potentiation of submaximal nicotinic currents. This result is consistent with the expression of the relatively rare alpha(5) nicotinic subunit in layer VI. In summary, we show that layer VI corticothalamic neurons can be strongly excited during development by an unusual subtype of nicotinic receptor.},

@article{keller1998a,
	Abstract = {The functional organization and synaptic physiology of olfactory bulb glomeruli were studied in rat in vitro slice preparations stained with the voltage-sensitive dye RH-155. Optical signals were recorded with a 100-element photodiode array at high temporal resolution. Pharmacological and ionic manipulations were used to investigate synaptic responses to stimulation of the olfactory nerve layer (ONL). ONL stimulation evoked a sodium-mediated compound action potential that propagated across the ONL and invaded individual glomeruli. This presynaptic volley evoked calcium-dependent synaptic responses the amplitudes of which were largest within the glomerular layer (GL); smaller amplitude responses were recorded in deeper layers of the olfactory bulb. Synaptic responses in the GL were attenuated by the non-NMDA ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonist CNQX; the residual component was suppressed by the NMDA glutamate receptor antagonist AP-5. The GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline methiodide had little effect, whereas the GABAB receptor agonist baclofen dramatically attenuated ONL-evoked synaptic responses. The effects of baclofen were reversed by the GABAB receptor antagonist CGP35348. Paired-pulse depression of ONL-evoked synaptic responses in the GL was partially reversed by CGP35348. These findings suggest that olfactory nerve axons release glutamate to activate both NMDA and non-NMDA receptors on GL neurons, that GABAA receptor-mediated inhibition has little effect on these responses, and that GABAB receptor-mediated inhibition may act presynaptically on olfactory nerve axons to modulate their inputs to olfactory bulb neurons.},

Famously, thalamic neurons are insensitive to stimulus orientation whereas their cortical targets easily resolve small changes in stimulus angle. There are two main types of cells in the visual cortex, simple and complex, defined by the structure of their receptive fields. Simple cells are thought to lay the groundwork for orientation selectivity. This review focuses on approaches that combine anatomy with physiology at the intracellular level, to explore the circuits that build simple receptive fields and that help to maintain neural sensitivity to stimulus features even when luminance contrast changes.},

	Abstract = {Helping and sharing among humans is often motivated by empathy and accompanied by a sense of satisfaction. To determine whether similar self-rewarding mechanisms may underpin assistance among nonhuman primates, eight female brown capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella) underwent testing in a simple choice paradigm. Paired with a partner, subjects could select either a "selfish" option that rewarded only themselves, or a "prosocial" option that rewarded both of them. Subjects systematically favored the prosocial option provided their partner was a) familiar, b) visible, and c) receiving rewards of equal value. Prosocial tendencies increased with social closeness, being lowest toward strangers and highest toward kin. That the monkeys understood the options was suggested by greater orientation to the partner during prosocial than selfish choices. Prosocial preferences were reduced by inequity, when the partner received a superior reward. If the view between both monkeys was blocked, choices became strikingly selfish. Thus, under certain conditions, delivering benefits to others seems gratifying to nonhuman primates.},

	Abstract = {1. We examined the spatiotemporal organization of ongoing activity in cat visual areas 17 and 18, in relation to the spontaneous activity of individual neurons. To search for coherent activity, voltage-sensitive dye signals were correlated with the activity of single neurons by the use of spike-triggered averaging. In each recording session an area of at least 2 x 2 mm of cortex was imaged, with 124 diodes. In addition, electrical recordings from two isolated units, the local field potential (LFP) from the same microelectrodes, and the surface electroencephalogram (EEG) were recorded simultaneously. 2. The optical signals recorded from the dye were similar to the LFP recorded from the same site. Optical signals recorded from different cortical sites exhibited a different time course. Therefore real-time optical imaging provides information that is equivalent in many ways to multiple-site LFP recordings. 3. The spontaneous firing of single neurons was highly correlated with the optical signals and with the LFP. In 88% of the neurons recorded during spontaneous activity, a significant correlation was found between the occurrence of a spike and the optical signal recorded in a large cortical region surrounding the recording site. This result indicates that spontaneous activity of single neurons is not an independent process but is time locked to the firing or to the synaptic inputs from numerous neurons, all activated in a coherent fashion even without a sensory input. 4. For the cases showing correlation with the optical signal, 27-36% of the optical signal during spike occurrence was directly related to the occurrence of spontaneous spikes in a single neuron, over an area of 2 x 2 mm. In the same cortical area, 43-55% of the activity was directly related to the visual stimulus. 5. Surprisingly, we found that the amplitude of this coherent ongoing activity, recorded optically, was often almost as large as the activity evoked by optimal visual stimulation. The amplitude of the ongoing activity that was directly and reproducibly related to the spontaneous spikes of a single neuron was, on average, as high as 54% of the amplitude of the visually evoked response that was directly related to optimal sensory stimulation, recorded optically. 6. Coherent activity was detected even at distant cortical sites up to 6 mm apart.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

The technique is simple, robust, efficient and well suited to simultaneous recordings from multiple neurons. It provides a complete and easily interpretable model of light responses even for neurons that display a common form of response nonlinearity that precludes classical linear systems analysis. A theoretical justification of the technique is presented that relies only on elementary linear algebra and statistics. Implementation is described with examples. The technique and the underlying model of neural responses are validated using recordings from retinal ganglion cells, and in principle are applicable to other neurons.

@article{grinvald1994a,
	Abstract = {Processing of retinal images is carried out in the myriad dendritic arborizations of cortical neurons. Such processing involves complex dendritic integration of numerous inputs, and the subsequent output is transmitted to multiple targets by extensive axonal arbors. Thus far, details of this intricate processing remained unexaminable. This report describes the usefulness of real-time optical imaging in the study of population activity and the exploration of cortical dendritic processing. In contrast to single-unit recordings, optical signals primarily measure the changes in transmembrane potential of a population of neuronal elements, including the often elusive subthreshold synaptic potentials that impinge on the extensive arborization of cortical cells. By using small visual stimuli with sharp borders and real-time imaging of cortical responses, we found that shortly after its onset, cortical activity spreads from its retinotopic site of initiation, covering an area at least 10 times larger, in upper cortical layers. The activity spreads at velocities from 100 to 250 microns/msec. Near the V1/V2 border the direct activation is anisotropic and we detected also anisotropic spread; the "space constant" for the spread was approximately 2.7 mm parallel to the border and approximately 1.5 mm along the perpendicular axis. In addition, we found cortical interactions between cortical activities evoked by a small "center stimulus" and by large "surround stimuli" positioned outside the classical receptive field. All of the surround stimuli used suppressed the cortical response to the center stimulus. Under some stimulus conditions iso-orientation suppression was more pronounced than orthogonal-orientation suppression. The orientation dependence of the suppression and its dependency on the size of some specific stimuli indicate that at least part of the center surround inhibitory interaction was of cortical origin. This findings reported here raise the possibility that distributed processing over a very large cortical area plays a major role in the processing of visual information by the primary visual cortex of the primate.},

	Abstract = {Management of Graves' ophthalmopathy is preferably done in a multidisciplinary setting. Smoking is associated with worse disease outcome. (131)I therapy for hyperthyroidism can also worsen ophthalmopathy, especially if administered during active disease or to patients who smoke or have severe hyperthyroidism, or those with high levels of TSH-receptor-binding inhibitory immunoglobulins. Coadministration of steroids and (131)I therapy is recommended for such high-risk patients. (131)I therapy is safe for patients with inactive Graves' ophthalmopathy. Subtotal thyroidectomy and antithyroid drugs show no benefit or harm to eye changes. There is no good evidence that total thyroid ablation has additional benefit. Artificial teardrops, dark glasses and prisms are very helpful. Dysthyroid optic neuropathy is best treated with intravenous pulsed methylprednisolone; if visual functions do not recover, urgent surgical decompression is indicated. A wait-and-see policy is recommended in mild Graves' ophthalmopathy because the natural history of this condition reveals a tendency to resolve spontaneously. Active, moderately severe Graves' ophthalmopathy qualifies for immunosuppression: intravenous pulsed methylprednisolone is more efficacious and has fewer side effects than oral steroids. Once the disease is inactive, rehabilitative surgery has much to offer. Quality of life is seriously limited in patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy, and remains restricted even after all treatments. Consequently, there is an urgent need for improved treatment modalities, and antibody therapy has shown promise in this respect.},

	Abstract = {The computations involved in the processing of a visual scene invariably involve the interactions among neurons throughout all of visual cortex. One hypothesis is that the timing of neuronal activity, as well as the amplitude of activity, provides a means to encode features of objects. The experimental data from studies on cat [Gray, C. M., K{\"o}nig, P., Engel, A. K. {\&} Singer, W. (1989) Nature (London) 338, 334-337] support a view in which only synchronous (no phase lags) activity carries information about the visual scene. In contrast, theoretical studies suggest, on the one hand, the utility of multiple phases within a population of neurons as a means to encode independent visual features and, on the other hand, the likely existence of timing differences solely on the basis of network dynamics. Here we use widefield imaging in conjunction with voltage-sensitive dyes to record electrical activity from the virtually intact, unanesthetized turtle brain. Our data consist of single-trial measurements. We analyze our data in the frequency domain to isolate coherent events that lie in different frequency bands. Low frequency oscillations (<5 Hz) are seen in both ongoing activity and activity induced by visual stimuli. These oscillations propagate parallel to the afferent input. Higher frequency activity, with spectral peaks near 10 and 20 Hz, is seen solely in response to stimulation. This activity consists of plane waves and spiral-like waves, as well as more complex patterns. The plane waves have an average phase gradient of approximately pi/2 radians/mm and propagate orthogonally to the low frequency waves. Our results show that large-scale differences in neuronal timing are present and persistent during visual processing.},

	Abstract = {Most models of visual search, whether involving overt eye movements or covert shifts of attention, are based on the concept of a saliency map, that is, an explicit two-dimensional map that encodes the saliency or conspicuity of objects in the visual environment. Competition among neurons in this map gives rise to a single winning location that corresponds to the next attended target. Inhibiting this location automatically allows the system to attend to the next most salient location. We describe a detailed computer implementation of such a scheme, focusing on the problem of combining information across modalities, here orientation, intensity and color information, in a purely stimulus-driven manner. The model is applied to common psychophysical stimuli as well as to a very demanding visual search task. Its successful performance is used to address the extent to which the primate visual system carries out visual search via one or more such saliency maps and how this can be tested.},

@article{williams2007a,
	Abstract = {While studying the visual response dynamics of neurons in the macaque primary visual cortex (V1), we found a nonlinearity of temporal response that influences the visual functions of V1 neurons. Simple cells were recorded in all layers of V1; the nonlinearity was strongest in neurons located in layer 2/3. We recorded the spike responses to optimal sinusoidal gratings that were displayed for 100 ms, a temporal step response. The step responses were measured at many spatial phases of the grating stimulus. To judge whether simple cell behavior was consistent with linear temporal integration, the decay of the 100 ms step response at the preferred spatial phase was used to predict the step response at the opposite spatial phase. Responses in layers 4B and 4C were mostly consistent with a linear-plus-static-nonlinearity cascade model. However, this was not true in layer 2/3 where most cells had little or no step responses at the opposite spatial phase. Many layer 2/3 cells had transient preferred-phase responses but did not respond at the offset of the opposite-phase stimuli, indicating a dynamic nonlinearity. A different stimulus sequence, rapidly presented random sinusoids, also produced the same effect, with layer 2/3 simple cells exhibiting elevated spike rates in response to stimuli at one spatial phase but not 180 degrees away. The presence of a dynamic nonlinearity in the responses of V1 simple cells indicates that first-order analyses often capture only a fraction of neuronal behavior. The visual implication of our results is that simple cells in layer 2/3 are spatial phase-sensitive detectors that respond to contrast boundaries of one sign but not the opposite.},

	Abstract = {One of the most impressive features of the central nervous system is its ability to process information from a variety of stimuli to produce an integrated, comprehensive representation of the external world. In the present study, the temporal disparity among combinations of different sensory stimuli was shown to be a critical factor influencing the integration of multisensory stimuli by superior colliculus neurons. Several temporal principles that govern multisensory integration were revealed: (1) maximal levels of response enhancement were generated by overlapping the peak discharge periods evoked by each modality; (2) the magnitude of this enhancement decayed monotonically to zero as the peak discharge periods became progressively more temporally disparate; (3) with further increases in temporal disparity, the same stimulus combinations that previously produced enhancement could often produce depression; and (4) these kinds of interactions could frequently be predicted from the discharge trains initiated by each stimulus alone. Since multisensory superior colliculus neurons project to premotor areas of the brain stem and spinal cord that control the orientation of the receptor organs (eyes, pinnae, head), they are believed to influence attentive and orientation behaviors. Therefore, it is likely that the temporal relationships of different environmental stimuli that control the activity of these neurons are also a powerful determinant of superior colliculus-mediated attentive and orientation behaviors.},

	Abstract = {We have discovered an evoked network oscillation in rat neocortical slices and have examined its spatiotemporal patterns with voltage-sensitive dye imaging. The slices (visual and auditory cortices) were prepared in a medium of low calcium, high magnesium and with sodium replaced by choline to reduce the excito-toxicity and sodium loading. After slicing, the choline was washed out while normal calcium, magnesium, and sodium concentrations were restored. The oscillation was evoked by a single electrical shock to slices bathed in normal artificial cerebral spinal fluid (ACSF). The oscillation was organized as an all-or-none epoch containing 4-13 cycles at a central frequency approximately 25 Hz. The activity can be reversibly blocked by 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxalene-2,3-dione (CNQX). 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (APV), and atropine but not by bicuculline, indicating polysynaptic excitatory mechanisms. Voltage-sensitive dye imaging showed high-amplitude oscillation signals in superficial and middle cortical layers. Spatiotemporally, the oscillations were organized as waves, propagating horizontally along cortical laminar. Each oscillation cycle was associated with one wave propagating in space. The waveforms were often different at different locations (e.g., extra cycles), suggesting the co-existence of multiple local oscillators. For different cycles, the waves often initiated at different locations, suggesting that local oscillators are competing to initiate each oscillation cycle. Overall our results suggest that this cortical network oscillation is organized at two levels: locally, oscillating neurons are tightly coupled to form local oscillators, and globally the coupling between local oscillators is weak, allowing abrupt spatial phase lags and propagating waves with multiple initiation sites.},

	Abstract = {We experience objects as whole, complete entities irrespective of whether they are perceived by our sensory systems or are recalled from memory. However, it is also known that many of the properties of objects are encoded and processed in different areas of the brain. How then, do coherent representations emerge? One theory suggests that rhythmic synchronization of neural discharges in the gamma band (around 40 Hz) may provide the necessary spatial and temporal links that bind together the processing in different brain areas to build a coherent percept. In this article we propose that this mechanism could also be used more generally for the construction of object representations that are driven by sensory input or internal, top-down processes. The review will focus on the literature on gamma oscillatory activities in humans and will describe the different types of gamma responses and how to analyze them. Converging evidence that suggests that one particular type of gamma activity (induced gamma activity) is observed during the construction of an object representation will be discussed.},

	Abstract = {More than 30 years after Hubel and Wiesel first described orientation selectivity in the mammalian visual cortex, the mechanism that gives rise to this property is still controversial. Hubel and Wiesel proposed a simple model for the origin of orientation tuning, in which the circularly symmetrical receptive fields of neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus that excite a cortical simple cell are arranged in rows. Since this model was proposed, several experiments and neuronal simulations have suggested that the connectivity between the lateral geniculate nucleus and the cortex is not well organized in an orientation-specific fashion, and that orientation tuning arises instead from extensive interactions within the cortex. To test these models we have recorded visually evoked synaptic potentials in simple cells while cooling the cortex, which largely inactivates the cortical network, but leaves geniculate synaptic input functional. We report that the orientation tuning of these potentials is almost unaffected by cooling the cortex, in agreement with Hubel and Wiesel's original proposal.},

Three Experiments examined whether the effect occurs because fixations are (a) shorter and fewer, (b) shorter, but more abundant, (c) equally long, but fewer, or (d) longer, but fewer when distractors are familiar. Results indicated comparably long, but fewer fixations when distractors are familiar. Hence, the theory that unfamiliar distractors need longer processing is discounted. In a fourth Experiment, a gaze-contingent moving window paradigm was used to control peripheral processing. Results revealed a wider span of effective processing for familiar distractors. A hypothesis based on low-level physiological processes is introduced to account for the familiarity effect.},

	Abstract = {The large dynamic range of natural stimuli poses a challenge for neural coding: how is a neuron to encode large differences at high contrast while remaining sensitive to small differences at low contrast? Many sensory neurons exhibit contrast normalization: gain depends on the range of stimuli presented, such that firing-rate modulation is not proportional to contrast. However, coding depends strongly on the precision of spike timing and the reliability of spike number, neither of which can be predicted from neural gain. The presumption that contrast normalization is associated with maintained coding efficiency remained untested. We report that, as contrast decreases, responses are more variable and encode less information, as expected. Nevertheless, these changes can be small, and information transmission is even better preserved across contrasts than rate modulation. The extent of contrast normalization is correlated with the extent to which information transmission is preserved across contrasts. Specifically, normalization is associated with maintaining the bits of information per spike rather than bits per second. Finally, we show that a nonadapting model can exhibit both contrast normalization and the associated information preservation.},

To address how the primary visual cortex represents object position we used a population approach that pools spiking activity of many neurones in cat area 17. In response to flashed stationary squares (0.4 deg) we obtained localized activity distributions in visual field coordinates, which we referred to as profiles across a population receptive field' (PRF). We here show how motion trajectories can be derived from activity across the PRF and how the representation of moving and flashed stimuli differs in position. We found that motion was represented by peaks of population activity that followed the stimulus with a speed-dependent lag. However, time-to-peak latencies were shorter by {\$}[{\$}\~{\$}]{\$}16 ms compared to the population responses to stationary flashes. In addition, motion representation showed a directional bias, as latencies were more reduced for peripheral-to-central motion compared to the opposite direction. We suggest that a moving stimulus provides preactivation' that allows more rapid processing than for a single flash event.},

	Abstract = {Correlated neuronal activity plays a fundamental role in the development of the nervous system. Using a multiple-site optical recording technique with a fast voltage-sensitive dye, we previously reported a novel form of correlated activity in the chick embryo, which showed wide propagation throughout the CNS. In this study, we report that similar wave activity is generated in the embryonic rat CNS. Electrical stimulation applied to the cervical cord evoked wave activity that traveled over a wide region of the CNS including the medulla, pons, midbrain, diencephalon, and spinal cord. Small signals were also detected from the cerebellum and part of the cerebrum. Stimulation applied to the cranial nerves such as the trigeminal and vagus nerves evoked waves with similar patterns, indicating that the wave is triggered by external sensory inputs. This wave activity was inhibited by glutamate-, acetylcholine-, GABA- and glycine-receptor antagonists in addition to gap junction blockers such as octanol and 18beta-glycyrrhetinic acid. In the immunohistochemical study, significant immunoreactivity of connexin26 and connexin32 was also observed. Wave activity detected with a voltage-sensitive dye was accompanied by a Ca(2+)-wave, indicating that it not only provides electrical synchrony but also biochemical signals associated with [Ca2+](i) elevation. These characteristics of the wave activity are similar to those of the depolarization wave reported in the chick embryo, suggesting that the large-scale depolarization wave is globally generated across different species.},

	Abstract = {In the realm of preventive medicine, there are three distinct types of prevention that can be defined. Primary prevention is the prevention of new disease in previously healthy individuals, usually achieved by decreasing risk factors for disease. Secondary prevention is the prevention of progression of mild or latent disease to more severe disease, and typically involves screening for occult disease. Tertiary prevention is the term used by some to describe medical care intended to improve already established disease. The role of primary prevention of thyroid disease in the United States is uncertain, because iodine deficiency is not clearly known to be a problem. In the case of secondary prevention of thyroid disease, this would necessarily involve screening of individuals for subclinical hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism with thyrotropin (TSH) testing. Using data from a large prevalence study and from the 2000 U.S. Census, it can be calculated that approximately 15 million adults have unrecognized thyroid disease, mostly subclinical hypothyroidism. If detected, secondary prevention might also entail treatment with antithyroid drugs/radioiodine or thyroxine to prevent sequelae or progression to a more advanced degree of thyrotoxicosis or thyroid failure, respectively. Over the next 20 years, it can be calculated that approximately 5 million people, mostly with subclinical hypothyroidism, will progress to overt disease. Tertiary prevention of thyroid disease would involve avoiding iatrogenic disease, such as thyroid hormone overdose. From epidemiologic data it can be calculated that approximately 600,00 elderly individuals have iatrogenic hyperthyroidism from thyroid hormone overdose, putting them at risk for atrial fibrillation and osteoporosis. Together, these data suggest that the notion of preventive medicine in the United States should be expanded to include thyroid disease as a target for secondary and tertiary intervention.},

	Abstract = {Various arguments suggest that neuronal coding of natural sensory stimuli should be sparse (i.e., individual neurons should respond rarely but should respond reliably). We examined sparseness of visual cortical neurons in anesthetized ferret to flashed natural scenes. Response behavior differed widely between neurons. The median firing rate of 4.1 impulses per second was slightly higher than predicted from consideration of metabolic load. Thirteen percent of neurons (12 of 89) responded to <5% of the images, but one-half responded to >25% of images. Multivariate analysis of the range of sparseness values showed that 67% of the variance was accounted for by differing response patterns to moving gratings. Repeat presentation of images showed that response variance for natural images exaggerated sparseness measures; variance was scaled with mean response, but with a lower Fano factor than for the responses to moving gratings. This response variability and the "soft" sparse responses (Rehn and Sommer, 2007) raise the question of what constitutes a reliable neuronal response and imply parallel signaling by multiple neurons. We investigated whether the temporal structure of responses might be reliable enough to give additional information about natural scenes. Poststimulus time histogram shape was similar for "strong" and "weak" stimuli, with no systematic change in first-spike latency with stimulus strength. The variance of first-spike latency for repeat presentations of the same image was greater than the latency variance between images. In general, responses to flashed natural scenes do not seem compatible with a sparse encoding in which neurons fire rarely but reliably.},

	Abstract = {Contrast-dependent changes in spatial summation and contextual modulation of primary visual cortex (V1) neuron responses to stimulation of their receptive field reveal long-distance integration of visual signals within V1, well beyond the classical receptive field (cRF) of single neurons. To identify the cortical circuits mediating these long-distance computations, we have used a combination of anatomical and physiological recording methods to determine the spatial scale and retinotopic logic of intra-areal V1 horizontal connections and inter-areal feedback connections to V1. We have then compared the spatial scales of these connectional systems to the spatial dimensions of the cRF, spatial summation field (SF), and modulatory surround field of macaque V1 neurons. We find that monosynaptic horizontal connections within area V1 are of an appropriate spatial scale to mediate interactions within the SF of V1 neurons and to underlie contrast-dependent changes in SF size. Contrary to common beliefs, these connections cannot fully account for the dimensions of the surround field. The spatial scale of feedback circuits from extrastriate cortex to V1 is, instead, commensurate with the full spatial range of center-surround interactions. Thus these connections could represent an anatomical substrate for contextual modulation and global-to-local integration of visual signals. Feedback projections connect corresponding and equal-sized regions of the visual field in striate and extrastriate cortices and cover anisotropic parts of visual space, unlike V1 horizontal connections that are isotropic in the macaque. V1 isotropic connectivity demonstrates that anisotropic horizontal connections are not necessary to generate orientation selectivity. Anisotropic feedback connections may play a role in contour completion.},

	Abstract = {During vision, it is believed that neural activity in the primary visual cortex is predominantly driven by sensory input from the environment. However, visual cortical neurons respond to repeated presentations of the same stimulus with a high degree of variability. Although this variability has been considered to be noise owing to random spontaneous activity within the cortex, recent studies show that spontaneous activity has a highly coherent spatio-temporal structure. This raises the possibility that the pattern of this spontaneous activity may shape neural responses during natural viewing conditions to a larger extent than previously thought. Here, we examine the relationship between spontaneous activity and the response of primary visual cortical neurons to dynamic natural-scene and random-noise film images in awake, freely viewing ferrets from the time of eye opening to maturity. The correspondence between evoked neural activity and the structure of the input signal was weak in young animals, but systematically improved with age. This improvement was linked to a shift in the dynamics of spontaneous activity. At all ages including the mature animal, correlations in spontaneous neural firing were only slightly modified by visual stimulation, irrespective of the sensory input. These results suggest that in both the developing and mature visual cortex, sensory evoked neural activity represents the modulation and triggering of ongoing circuit dynamics by input signals, rather than directly reflecting the structure of the input signal itself.},

	Abstract = {Although it is known that visual imagery is accompanied by activity in visual cortical areas, including primary visual cortex, whether olfactory imagery exists remains controversial. Here we asked whether cue-dependent olfactory imagery was similarly accompanied by activity in olfactory cortex, and in particular whether hedonic-specific patterns of activity evident in olfactory perception would also be present during olfactory imagery. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure activity in subjects who alternated between smelling and imagining pleasant and unpleasant odors. Activity induced by imagining odors mimicked that induced by perceiving real odorants, not only in the particular brain regions activated, but also in its hedonic-specific pattern. For both real and imagined odors, unpleasant stimuli induced greater activity than pleasant stimuli in the left frontal portion of piriform cortex and left insula. These findings combine with findings from other modalities to suggest activation of primary sensory cortical structures during mental imagery of sensory events.},

	Abstract = {The primary visual cortex (V1) is pre-wired to facilitate the extraction of behaviorally important visual features. Collinear edge detectors in V1, for instance, mutually enhance each other to improve the perception of lines against a noisy background. The same pre-wiring that facilitates line extraction, however, is detrimental when subjects have to discriminate the brightness of different line segments. How is it possible to improve in one task by unsupervised practicing, without getting worse in the other task? The classical view of perceptual learning is that practicing modulates the feedforward input stream through synaptic modifications onto or within V1. However, any rewiring of V1 would deteriorate other perceptual abilities different from the trained one. We propose a general neuronal model showing that perceptual learning can modulate top-down input to V1 in a task-specific way while feedforward and lateral pathways remain intact. Consistent with biological data, the model explains how context-dependent brightness discrimination is improved by a top-down recruitment of recurrent inhibition and a top-down induced increase of the neuronal gain within V1. Both the top-down modulation of inhibition and of neuronal gain are suggested to be universal features of cortical microcircuits which enable perceptual learning.},

@article{carandini2000a,
	Abstract = {We have investigated the relationship between membrane potential and firing rate in cat visual cortex and found that the spike threshold contributes substantially to the sharpness of orientation tuning. The half-width at half-height of the tuning of the spike responses was 23 +/- 8 degrees, compared with 38 +/- 15 degrees for the membrane potential responses. Direction selectivity was also greater in spike responses (direction index, 0.61 +/- 0.35) than in membrane potential responses (0.28 +/- 0.21). Threshold also increased the distinction between simple and complex cells, which is commonly based on the linearity of the spike responses to drifting sinusoidal gratings. In many simple cells, such stimuli evoked substantial elevations in the mean potential, which are nonlinear. Being subthreshold, these elevations would be hard to detect in the firing rate responses. Moreover, just as simple cells displayed various degrees of nonlinearity, complex cells displayed various degrees of linearity. We fitted the firing rates with a classic rectification model in which firing rate is zero at potentials below a threshold and grows linearly with the potential above threshold. When the model was applied to a low-pass-filtered version of the membrane potential (with spikes removed), the estimated values of threshold (-54.4 +/- 1.4 mV) and linear gain (7.2 +/- 0.6 spikes. sec(-1). mV(-1)) were similar across the population. The predicted firing rates matched the observed firing rates well and accounted for the sharpening of orientation tuning of the spike responses relative to that of the membrane potential. As it was for stimulus orientation, threshold was also independent of stimulus contrast. The rectification model accounted for the dependence of spike responses on contrast and, because of a stimulus-induced tonic hyperpolarization, for the response adaptation induced by prolonged stimulation. Because gain and threshold are unaffected by visual stimulation and by adaptation, we suggest that they are constant under all conditions.},

	Abstract = {Recent studies have recovered receptive-field maps of simple cells in visual cortex from their responses to natural scene stimuli. Natural scenes have many theoretical and practical advantages over traditional, artificial stimuli; however, the receptive-field estimation methods are more complex than for white-noise stimuli. Here, we describe and justify several of these methods-spectral correction of the reverse correlation estimate, direct least-squares solution, iterative least-squares algorithms and regularized least-squares solutions. We investigate the pros and cons of the different methods, and evaluate them in a head-to-head comparison for simulated simple-cell data. This shows that, at least for quasilinear simulated simple cells, a regularized solution ('reginv') is most efficient, requiring fewer stimulus presentations for high-resolution reconstruction of the first-order kernel. We also investigate several practical issues that determine the success of this kind of experiment-the effects of neuronal nonlinearities, response variability and the choice of stimulus regime.},

	Abstract = {A fundamental aspect of visuomotor behavior is deciding where to look or move next. Under certain conditions, the brain constructs an internal representation of stimulus location on the basis of previous knowledge and uses it to move the eyes or to make other movements. Neuronal responses in primary visual cortex were modulated when such an internal representation was acquired: Responses to a stimulus were affected progressively by sequential presentation of the stimulus at one location but not when the location was varied randomly. Responses of individual neurons were spatially tuned for gaze direction and tracked the Bayesian probability of stimulus appearance. We propose that the representation arises in a distributed cortical network and is associated with systematic changes in response selectivity and dynamics at the earliest stages of cortical visual processing.},

	Abstract = {The ability to recognize and accurately interpret facial expressions are critical social cognition skills in primates, yet very few studies have examined how primates discriminate these social signals and which features are the most salient. Four experiments examined chimpanzee facial expression processing using a set of standardized, prototypical stimuli created using the new ChimpFACS coding system. First, chimpanzees were found to accurately discriminate between these expressions using a computerized matching-to-sample task, and recognition was impaired for all but one expression category when they were inverted. Third, a multidimensional scaling analysis examined the perceived dissimilarity among these facial expressions revealing 2 main dimensions, the degree of mouth closure and extent of lip-puckering and retraction. Finally, subjects were asked to match each facial expression category using only individual component features. For each expression category, at least 1 component movement was more salient or representative of that expression than the others. However, these were not necessarily the only movements implicated in subject's overall pattern of errors. Therefore, similar to humans, both configuration and component movements are important during chimpanzee facial expression processing.},

@article{beauchamp2005a,
	Abstract = {Inferences drawn from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies are dependent on the statistical criteria used to define different brain regions as "active" or "inactive" under the experimental manipulation. In fMRI studies of multisensory integration, additional criteria are used to classify a subset of the active brain regions as "multisensory." Because there is no general agreement in the literature on the optimal criteria for performing this classification, we investigated the effects of seven different multisensory statistical criteria on a single test dataset collected as human subjects performed auditory, visual, and auditory- visual object recognition. Activation maps created using the different criteria differed dramatically. The classification of the superior temporal sulcus (STS) was used as a performance measure, because a large body of converging evidence demonstrates that the STS is important for auditory-visual integration. A commonly proposed criterion, "supra-additivity" or "super-additivity", which requires the multisensory response to be larger than the summed unisensory responses, did not classify STS as multisensory. Alternative criteria, such as requiring the multisensory response to be larger than the maximum or the mean of the unisensory responses, successfully classified STS as multisensory. This practical demonstration strengthens theoretical arguments that the super-additivity is not an appropriate criterion for all studies of multisensory integration. Moreover, the importance of examining evoked fMRI responses, whole brain activation maps, maps from multiple individual subjects, and mixed-effect group maps are discussed in the context of selecting statistical criteria.},

	Abstract = {Neurons in macaque ventral premotor cortex and inferior parietal lobe discharge during both the observation and the execution of motor acts. It has been claimed that these so-called mirror neurons form the basis of action understanding by matching the visual input with the corresponding motor program (direct matching). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) adaptation can be used to test the direct matching account of action recognition by determining whether putative mirror neurons show adaptation for repeated motor acts independently of whether they are observed or executed. An unambiguous test of the hypothesis requires that the motor acts be meaningless to ensure that any adaptation effect is directly because of movement recognition/motor execution and not contextually determined inferences. We found adaptation for motor acts that were repeatedly observed or repeatedly executed. We also found adaptation for motor acts that were first observed and then executed, as would be expected if a previously seen act primed the subsequent execution of that act. Crucially, we found no signs of adaptation for motor acts that were first executed and then observed. Failure to find cross-modal adaptation for executed and observed motor acts is not compatible with the core assumption of mirror neuron theory, which holds that action recognition and understanding are based on motor simulation.},

In the present study, patterns of ocular dominance and orientation selectivity were obtained repeatedly from the same patch of cortex using the dye merocyanine oxazolone, together with current image-processing techniques. The patterns observed agree with most established features of monkey striate cortex and suggest a new unit of cortical organization; one that is modular in structure and which appears to link the organization of orientation selectivity with that of ocular dominance.},

In order to generate accurate internal representations of the external world, the brain must decode both types of encoded information, even when processing stationary stimuli. We review here evidence in support of a parallel processing scheme for spatially and temporally encoded information in the tactile system and discuss the advantages and limitations of sensory-derived temporal coding in both the tactile and visual systems. Based on a large body of data, we propose a dynamic theory for vision, which avoids the impediments of previous dynamic theories.},

@article{einhaeuser2003a,
	Abstract = {In natural environments, humans select a subset of visual stimuli by directing their gaze to locations attended. In previous studies it has been found that at fixation points luminance-contrast is higher than average. This led to the hypothesis that luminance-contrast makes a major contribution to a saliency map of visual overt attention, consistent with a computation of stimulus saliency in early visual cortical areas. We re-evaluate this hypothesis by using natural and modified natural images to uncover the causal effects of luminance-contrast to human overt visual attention and: (i) we confirm that when viewing natural images, contrasts are elevated at fixation points. This, however, only holds for low spatial frequencies and in a limited temporal window after stimulus onset; (ii) however, despite this correlation between overt attention and luminance-contrast, moderate modifications of contrast in natural images do not measurably affect the selection of fixation points. Furthermore, strong local reductions of luminance-contrast do not repel but attract fixation; (iii) neither contrast nor contrast modification is correlated to fixation duration; and (iv), even the moderate contrast modifications used fall into the physiologically relevant range, and subjects are well able to detect them in a forced choice paradigm. In summary, no causal contribution of luminance-contrast to a saliency map of human overt attention is detectable. In conjunction with recent results on the relation of contrast sensitivity of neuronal activity to the level in the visual cortical hierarchy, the present study provides evidence that, for natural scenes, saliency is computed not early but late during processing.},

@article{kayser2007b,
	Abstract = {Our different senses provide complementary evidence about the environment and their interaction often aids behavioral performance or alters the quality of the sensory percept. A traditional view defers the merging of sensory information to higher association cortices, and posits that a large part of the brain can be reduced into a collection of unisensory systems that can be studied in isolation. Recent studies, however, challenge this view and suggest that cross-modal interactions can already occur in areas hitherto regarded as unisensory. We review results from functional imaging and electrophysiology exemplifying cross-modal interactions that occur early during the evoked response, and at the earliest stages of sensory cortical processing. Although anatomical studies revealed several potential origins of these cross-modal influences, there is yet no clear relation between particular functional observations and specific anatomical connections. In addition, our view on sensory integration at the neuronal level is coined by many studies on subcortical model systems of sensory integration; yet, the patterns of cross-modal interaction in cortex deviate from these model systems in several ways. Consequently, future studies on cortical sensory integration need to leave the descriptive level and need to incorporate cross-modal influences into models of the organization of sensory processing. Only then will we be able to determine whether early cross-modal interactions truly merit the label sensory integration, and how they increase a sensory system's ability to scrutinize its environment and finally aid behavior.},

@article{pijl2001a,
	Abstract = {We explored energy and macronutrient intake in patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism. We specifically hypothesized that hyperthyroidism is associated with increased appetite for carbohydrates, because of enhanced sympathetic tone and diminished serotonin mediated neurotransmission in the brain. To test this hypothesis, we measured food intake by dietary history and food selected for lunch in the laboratory in 14 patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism. Twenty-four-hour catecholamine excretion was used as a measure of activity of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and the plasma [Trp]/[NAA] ratio was measured to estimate (rate limiting) precursor availability for brain 5-hydroxytryptamine synthesis. All measurements were repeated after the subjects had been treated to establish euthyroidism. In addition, the effects of nonselective beta-adrenoceptor blockade upon these parameters were studied to evaluate the influence of beta-adrenergic hyperactivity on food intake. Hyperthyroidism was marked by increased SNS activity and reduced plasma [Trp]/[NAA] ratio. Accordingly, energy intake was considerably and significantly increased in hyper vs. euthyroidism, which was fully attributable to enhanced carbohydrate consumption, as protein and fat intake were not affected. These results suggest that hyperthyroidism alters the neurophysiology of food intake regulation. Increased SNS activity and reduced Trp precursor availability for 5-hydroxytryptamine synthesis in the brain may drive the marked hyperphagia and craving for carbohydrates that appears to characterize hyperthyroid patients. Because propranolol did not affect food intake in hyperthyroidism, the potential effect of catecholamines on food intake might be mediated by alpha-adrenoceptors.},

Experimental evidence is adduced for this view of human vision. The internal model must approximate the external world, since our species has survived. Alternately, certain bottom-up image processing algorithms may inversely serve to identify approximate sub-features or regions of interest of the internal model. Our results indicate, however, that these algorithms can not predict the sequential ordering of the subfeatures used by a person. Applications of schemata exploiting the above notions are suggested for: image compression; guided viewing of computer screens for increased efficiency; and compensating distortions for such eye lesions as scotomas},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To review the etiology, diagnosis, and clinical presentation of Graves disease and provide an overview of the standard and adjunctive treatments. Specifically, antithyroid drugs, beta-blockers, inorganic iodide, lithium, and radioactive iodine are discussed, focusing on current controversies. DATA SOURCES: Primary articles were identified through a MEDLINE search (1966-July 2000). Key word searches included beta-blockers, Graves disease, inorganic iodide, lithium, methimazole, and propylthiouracil. Additional articles from these sources and endocrinology textbooks were also identified. We agreed to include articles that would highlight the most relevant points, as well as current areas of controversy. DATA SYNTHESIS: Graves disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. The 3 main treatment options for patients with Graves hyperthyroidism include antithyroid drugs, radioactive iodine, and surgery. Although the antithyroid drugs propylthiouracil (PTU) and methimazole (MMI) have similar efficacy, there are situations when 1 agent is preferred. MMI has a longer half-life than PTU, allowing once-daily dosing that can improve patient adherence to treatment. PTU has historically been the drug of choice for treating pregnant and breast-feeding women because of its limited transfer into the placenta and breast milk. Adjuvant therapies for Graves disease include beta-blockers, inorganic iodide, and lithium. beta-Blockers are used to decrease the symptoms of hyperthyroidism. Inorganic iodide is primarily used to prepare patients for thyroid surgery because of its ability to decrease the vascularity of the thyroid gland. Lithium, which acts in a manner similar to iodine, is not routinely used due to its transient effect and the risk of potentially serious adverse effects. In the US, radioiodine therapy has become the preferred treatment for adults with Graves disease. It is easy to administer, safe, effective, and more affordable than long-term treatment with antithyroid drugs. Hypothyroidism is an inevitable consequence of radioiodine therapy. Radioiodine is contraindicated in pregnant women because it can damage the fetal thyroid gland, resulting in fetal hypothyroidism. Bilateral subtotal thyroidectomy, which was once the only treatment available, is now performed only in special circumstances. In addition to the normal risks associated with surgery, laryngeal nerve damage, hypoparathyroidism, and hypothyroidism can occur following that procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Despite extensive experience with medical management, controversy prevails regarding choosing among the various drugs for treatment of Graves disease. None of the treatment options, including antithyroid drugs, radioiodine, and surgery, is ideal. Each has risks and benefits, and selection should be tailored to the individual patient.},

	Abstract = {Spectral signal analysis constitutes one of the most important and most commonly used analytical tools for the evaluation of neurophysiological signals. It is not only the spectral parameters per se (amplitude and phase) which are of interest, but there is also a variety of measures derived from them, including important coupling measures like coherence or phase synchrony. After reviewing some of these measures in order to underline the widespread relevance of spectral analysis, this report compares the three classical spectral analysis approaches: Fourier, Hilbert and wavelet transform. Recently, there seems to be increasing acceptance of the notion that Hilbert- or wavelet-based analyses be in some way superior to Fourier-based analyses. The present article counters such views by demonstrating that the three techniques are in fact formally (i.e. mathematically) equivalent when using the class of wavelets that is typically applied in spectral analyses. Moreover, spectral amplitude serves as an example to show that Fourier, Hilbert and wavelet analysis also yield equivalent results in practical applications to neuronal signals.},

	Abstract = {The model proposed by the authors of two cortical systems providing 'vision for action' and 'vision for perception', respectively, owed much to the inspiration of Larry Weiskrantz. In the present article some essential concepts inherent in the model are summarized, and certain clarifications and refinements are offered. Some illustrations are given of recent experiments by ourselves and others that have prompted us to sharpen these concepts. Our explicit hope in writing our book in 1995 was to provide a theoretical framework that would stimulate research in the field. Conversely, well-designed empirical contributions conceived within the framework of the model are the only way for us to progress along the route towards a fully fleshed-out specification of its workings.},

	Abstract = {Here we investigate the counting ability in honeybees by training them to receive a food reward after they have passed a specific number of landmarks. The distance to the food reward is varied frequently and randomly, whilst keeping the number of intervening landmarks constant. Thus, the bees cannot identify the food reward in terms of its distance from the hive. We find that bees can count up to four objects, when they are encountered sequentially during flight. Furthermore, bees trained in this way are able count novel objects, which they have never previously encountered, thus demonstrating that they are capable of object-independent counting. A further experiment reveals that the counting ability that the bees display in our experiments is primarily sequential in nature. It appears that bees can navigate to food sources by maintaining a running count of prominent landmarks that are passed en route, provided this number does not exceed four.},

	Abstract = {Visual attention is a mechanism which filters out redundant visual information and detects the most relevant parts of our visual field. Automatic determination of the most visually relevant areas would be useful in many applications such as image and video coding, watermarking, video browsing, and quality assessment. Many research groups are currently investigating computational modeling of the visual attention system. The first published computational models have been based on some basic and well-understood Human Visual System (HVS) properties. These models feature a single perceptual layer that simulates only one aspect of the visual system. More recent models integrate complex features of the HVS and simulate hierarchical perceptual representation of the visual input. The bottom-up mechanism is the most occurring feature found in modern models. This mechanism refers to involuntary attention (i.e., salient spatial visual features that effortlessly or involuntary attract our attention). This paper presents a coherent computational approach to the modeling of the bottom-up visual attention. This model is mainly based on the current understanding of the HVS behavior. Contrast sensitivity functions, perceptual decomposition, visual masking, and center-surround interactions are some of the features implemented in this model. The performances of this algorithm are assessed by using natural images and experimental measurements from an eye-tracking system. Two adequate well-known metrics (correlation coefficient and Kullbacl-Leibler divergence) are used to validate this model. A further metric is also defined. The results from this model are finally compared to those from a reference bottom-up model.},

	Abstract = {Sensory areas should be adapted to the properties of their natural stimuli. What are the underlying rules that match the properties of complex cells in primary visual cortex to their natural stimuli? To address this issue, we sampled movies from a camera carried by a freely moving cat, capturing the dynamics of image motion as the animal explores an outdoor environment. We use these movie sequences as input to simulated neurons. Following the intuition that many meaningful high-level variables, e.g., identities of visible objects, do not change rapidly in natural visual stimuli, we adapt the neurons to exhibit firing rates that are stable over time. We find that simulated neurons, which have optimally stable activity, display many properties that are observed for cortical complex cells. Their response is invariant with respect to stimulus translation and reversal of contrast polarity. Furthermore, spatial frequency selectivity and the aspect ratio of the receptive field quantitatively match the experimentally observed characteristics of complex cells. Hence, the population of complex cells in the primary visual cortex can be described as forming an optimally stable representation of natural stimuli.},

	Abstract = {Ever since Hubel and Wiesel described orientation selectivity in the visual cortex, the question of how precise selectivity emerges has been marked by considerable debate. There are essentially two views of how selectivity arises. Feed-forward models rely entirely on the organization of thalamocortical inputs. Feedback models rely on lateral inhibition to refine selectivity relative to a weak bias provided by thalamocortical inputs. The debate is driven by two divergent lines of evidence. On the one hand, many response properties appear to require lateral inhibition, including precise orientation and direction selectivity and crossorientation suppression. On the other hand, intracellular recordings have failed to find consistent evidence for lateral inhibition. Here we demonstrate a resolution to this paradox. Feed-forward models incorporating the intrinsic nonlinear properties of cortical neurons and feed-forward circuits (i.e., spike threshold, contrast saturation, and spike-rate rectification) can account for properties that have previously appeared to require lateral inhibition.},
	Annote = {very nice review to understand and to be updated all/about the concepts related to early visual processing using simple/classical stimuli. A little old school but still it is the main stream science. Apparent Failures of the feedforward model of simple cell (1) the sharpness of orientation tuning, which is far narrower than predicted by the spatial organization of the feed-forward input. Small RF's must have much broader orientation tuning than elongated RFs. This is the case for Vm tuning, but not for spikes tuning curves. ==> ICEBERG effect accounts for this. "Sharpness of orientation tuning, then, can be accounted for quantita- tively by feed-forward geniculo-cortical input to simple cells, as long as the nonlinear effects of threshold are taken into account." (2) crossorientation suppression, in which a stimulus of the nonpreferred orientation suppresses the response to a stimulus of the preferred orientation; (!) it is a binocular effect!, when the mask is presented to the other eye there is no crossorientation inhibition (therefore can not be cortical inhibition) (!)strong suppression can be evoked by very high frequency stimuli, higher than what cortical neurons can response to (therefore cant come from the cortex). (!)latency of the inhibition is same as excitation so cant be inhibitory cells. "Now when the plaid is introduced, the response of the third relay cell still falls to zero because its stimulus has zero con- trast. The response of the bottom relay cell, however, no longer doubles. Although the mask stimulus doubles the local contrast relative to the test stimulus alone (Figure 3C, left), because the test stimulus was already nearly saturating, the cell's response increases only slightly (right). Altogether then, the mask stimulus causes the total input to the simple cell to fall, in this case by approximately 15%.crossorientation effects in simple cells (Priebe and Ferster, 2006). " (3) contrast invariance of orientation tuning, in which simple cells fail to respond to nonpreferred stimuli of any strength (contrast), and the width of orientation tuning varies little with changes in the contrast; and (4) dynamics of orientation tuning, in which tuning width narrows over the time course of a response.The most direct way to test for the presence of synaptic inhibition is through intracellular recording. Inhibition could reveal itself as a frank hyperpolarization.},

Nonclassical, extra-receptive fields (ERFs) can either inhibit or facilitate the response elicited by stimulation within the CRF. Here, we report that in the primary visual cortex of cat, neurons with similar inhibitory or facilitatory ERF properties are also grouped into clusters. These clusters are randomly distributed in all cortical layers, with no detectable relationship with orientation and ocular dominance columns. This functional organization of neurons with respect to ERF properties may allow an efficient processing of global visual information.},

	Abstract = {Patterns of spontaneous activity in the developing retina, LGN, and cortex are necessary for the proper development of visual cortex. With these patterns intact, the primary visual cortices of many newborn animals develop properties similar to those of the adult cortex but without the training benefit of visual experience. Previous models have demonstrated how V1 responses can be initialized through mechanisms specific to development and prior to visual experience, such as using axonal guidance cues or relying on simple, pairwise correlations on spontaneous activity with additional developmental constraints. We argue that these spontaneous patterns may be better understood as part of an "innate learning" strategy, which learns similarly on activity both before and during visual experience. With an abstraction of spontaneous activity models, we show how the visual system may be able to bootstrap an efficient code for its natural environment prior to external visual experience, and we continue the same refinement strategy upon natural experience. The patterns are generated through simple, local interactions and contain the same relevant statistical properties of retinal waves and hypothesized waves in the LGN and V1. An efficient encoding of these patterns resembles a sparse coding of natural images by producing neurons with localized, oriented, bandpass structure-the same code found in early visual cortical cells. We address the relevance of higher-order statistical properties of spontaneous activity, how this relates to a system that may adapt similarly on activity prior to and during natural experience, and how these concepts ultimately relate to an efficient coding of our natural world.},

	Abstract = {The essential micronutrient selenium (Se) occurs in the form of the amino acid selenocysteine in selenoproteins which exert various effects, while maintaining the cell reduction-oxidation balance. The discovery that all three deiodinases that convert thyroxine (T4) into triiodothyronine (T3) contain selenocysteine illustrates how the production of the active thyroid hormone is dependent on Se status. The selenoenzyme families of glutathione peroxidases (GPx) and thioredoxin reductases (TRx) possess powerful antioxidant properties and form a complex defense system that protects thyrocytes from oxidative damage. Se supplementation in patients with autoimmune thyroiditis seems to modify the immune response, probably by enhancing plasma GPx activity and decreasing excess levels of hydrogen peroxide. However, the enhancement of immunocompetence may also be the result of the synergistic action of various selenoproteins and not exclusively of GPx. There is evidence supporting considerable oxidative stress in Graves' disease where Se supplementation, because of its free radical scavenging properties, may increase the enzymatic antioxidant activity. TRx has been found significantly elevated in GD revealing its involvement in the pathogenesis of this condition and representing a potential future target for therapeutical intervention. Low Se serum levels have also been associated with increased risk of thyroid cancer and may play a role in carcinogenesis. It is noteworthy, that the Food and Drug Administration has recently determined that there is sufficient evidence to warrant a qualified health claim for Se and cancer. Furthermore, the recent discovery that defects in the SECIS-binding protein 2 (SBP2), which is an indispensable protein for the incorporation of Se into the selenoproteins, result in thyroid dysfunction, together with the recognition of the many roles of selenoprotein P in Se distribution and storage in the human body, reveal not only the indispensability of Se and the selenoproteins as essential factors in thyroid metabolism and pathogenesis, but open up new prospects for enhanced treatment.},

	Abstract = {The brain should integrate related but not unrelated information from different senses. Temporal patterning of inputs to different modalities may provide critical information about whether those inputs are related or not. We studied effects of temporal correspondence between auditory and visual streams on human brain activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Streams of visual flashes with irregularly jittered, arrhythmic timing could appear on right or left, with or without a stream of auditory tones that coincided perfectly when present (highly unlikely by chance), were noncoincident with vision (different erratic, arrhythmic pattern with same temporal statistics), or an auditory stream appeared alone. fMRI revealed blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) increases in multisensory superior temporal sulcus (mSTS), contralateral to a visual stream when coincident with an auditory stream, and BOLD decreases for noncoincidence relative to unisensory baselines. Contralateral primary visual cortex and auditory cortex were also affected by audiovisual temporal correspondence or noncorrespondence, as confirmed in individuals. Connectivity analyses indicated enhanced influence from mSTS on primary sensory areas, rather than vice versa, during audiovisual correspondence. Temporal correspondence between auditory and visual streams affects a network of both multisensory (mSTS) and sensory-specific areas in humans, including even primary visual and auditory cortex, with stronger responses for corresponding and thus related audiovisual inputs.},

	Abstract = {Area MT (middle temporal) is a well-defined visual representation common to all primates, which shows a clear selectivity to the analysis of visual motion. In the present study we examined the architecture of the intrinsic connections in area MT in an attempt to reveal its organizing principles and its potential relationship to the functional domains in area MT. Intrinsic connections were studied by placing small injections of the tracer biocytin in area MT of seven adult owl monkeys (Aotus nancymae). The injections were targeted at well-defined orientation domains revealed using optical imaging of intrinsic signals. The distribution of axons labeled by these injections was related both to the cytochrome oxidase histochemistry and to the layout of functional domains in area MT and surrounding tissue. Tracer injections in the superficial layers of area MT produced a complex network of extrinsic and intrinsic axonal connections. Clear instances of extrinsic connections were observed between area MT proper and the MT crescent situated postero-medially to it. The intrinsic connections were laterally spread and organized in patch-like clusters with an average distance from injection center to the furthest patch of 1.8 +/- 0.55 mm (+/-SD, n = 9). The overall axonal distribution tended to be anisotropic, i.e. the patches were distributed within an elongated ellipse [average anisotropy ratio: 1.86 +/- 0.66 (+/-SD)] and were asymmetrically distributed about either side of the injection site [average asymmetry ratio: 2.3 +/- 0.7 (+/-SD)]. Finally, there was a tendency for the intrinsic connections to connect to functional domains of similar orientation preference in area MT. However, this tendency varied substantially between individual cases. The highly specific nature of MT lateral connections puts clear constraints on models of surround influences in the receptive fields of MT neurons.},

	Abstract = {Decision theory proposes that humans and animals decide what to do in a given situation by assessing the relative value of each possible response. This assessment can be computed, in part, from the probability that each action will result in a gain and the magnitude of the gain expected. Here we show that the gain (or reward) a monkey can expect to realize from an eye-movement response modulates the activity of neurons in the lateral intraparietal area, an area of primate cortex that is thought to transform visual signals into eye-movement commands. We also show that the activity of these neurons is sensitive to the probability that a particular response will result in a gain. When animals can choose freely between two alternative responses, the choices subjects make and neuronal activation in this area are both correlated with the relative amount of gain that the animal can expect from each response. Our data indicate that a decision-theoretic model may provide a powerful new framework for studying the neural processes that intervene between sensation and action.},

	Abstract = {The basic structure of receptive fields and functional maps in primary visual cortex is established without exposure to normal sensory experience and before the onset of the critical period. How the brain wires these circuits in the early stages of development remains unknown. Possible explanations include activity-dependent mechanisms driven by spontaneous activity in the retina and thalamus, and molecular guidance orchestrating thalamo-cortical connections on a fine spatial scale. Here I propose an alternative hypothesis: the blueprint for receptive fields, feature maps, and their inter-relationships may reside in the layout of the retinal ganglion cell mosaics along with a simple statistical connectivity scheme dictating the wiring between thalamus and cortex. The model is shown to account for a number of experimental findings, including the relationship between retinotopy, orientation maps, spatial frequency maps and cytochrome oxidase patches. The theory's simplicity, explanatory and predictive power makes it a serious candidate for the origin of the functional architecture of primary visual cortex.},

	Abstract = {It is commonly assumed that the orientation-selective surround field of neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) is due to interactions provided solely by intrinsic long-range horizontal connections. We review evidence for and against this proposition and conclude that horizontal connections are too slow and cover too little visual field to subserve all the functions of suppressive surrounds of V1 neurons in the macaque monkey. We show that the extent of visual space covered by horizontal connections corresponds to the region of low contrast summation of the receptive field center mechanism. This region encompasses the classically defined receptive field center and the proximal surround. Beyond this region, feedback connections are the most likely substrate for surround suppression.

	Abstract = {Statistical analysis of natural sounds and speech reveals logarithmically distributed spectrotemporal modulations that can cover several orders of magnitude. By contrast, most artificial stimuli used to probe auditory function, including pure tones and white noise, have linearly distributed amplitude fluctuations with a limited average dynamic range. Here we explore whether the operating range of the auditory system is physically matched to the statistical structure of natural sounds. We recorded single-unit and multi-unit neuronal activity from the central nucleus of the cat inferior colliculus (ICC) in response to dynamic spectrotemporal sound sequences to determine whether ICC neurons respond preferentially to linear or logarithmic spectrotemporal amplitudes. We varied the intensity, dynamic range, and contrast statistics of these sounds to mimic those of natural and artificial stimuli. ICC neurons exhibited monotonic and nonmonotonic contrast dependencies with increasing dynamic range that were independent of the stimulus intensity. Midbrain neurons had higher firing rates and higher receptive field energies and showed a net improvement in spectrotemporal encoding ability for logarithmic stimuli, with an increase in the mutual information rate of approximately 50% over linear amplitude sounds. This efficient use of logarithmic spectrotemporal modulations by auditory midbrain neurons reflects a neural adaptation to structural regularities in natural sounds and likely underlies human perceptual abilities.},

	Abstract = {We measured contrast detection thresholds for a small (3.6 x 3.6 arc min) square target in the presence and absence of spatially identical pedestal stimuli, and of a spatially non-overlapping inducing line (3.6 x 23 arc min). Results for the pedestal stimuli replicated the classical "dipper function", thresholds being reduced by near-threshold pedestals and increased at higher pedestal contrasts. An inducer without a pedestal also decreased detection thresholds. When the inducer and pedestal were combined, their effects were additive. Thus the inducer facilitated target detection when the pedestal was absent but raised detection thresholds when the pedestal contrast was sufficient by itself to lower threshold. Inducers of opposite polarity to the target did not consistently decrease target thresholds, even when they were clearly visible, arguing against spatial uncertainty as the explanation of the inducer effect. The inducer effect was independent of the length of the inducer except with small (< 3.6 arc min) stimuli, and was abolished by increasing target-inducer separation beyond about 10 arc min.},

	Abstract = {Optical imaging of cortical activity offers several advantages over conventional electrophysiological and anatomical techniques. One can map a relatively large region, obtain successive maps to different stimuli in the same cortical area and follow variations in response over time. In the intact mammalian brain this imaging has been accomplished with the aid of voltage sensitive dyes. However, it has been known for many years that some intrinsic changes in the optical properties of the tissue are dependent on electrical or metabolic activity. Here we show that these changes can be used to study the functional architecture of cortex. Optical maps of whisker barrels in the rat and the orientation columns in the cat visual cortex, obtained by reflection measurements of the intrinsic signal, were confirmed with voltage sensitive dyes or by electrophysiological recordings. In addition, we describe an intrinsic signal originating from small arteries which can be used to investigate the communication between local neuronal activity and the microvasculature. One advantage of the method is that it is non-invasive and does not require dyes, a clear benefit for clinical applications.},

Chimpanzees display a complex, flexible facial expression repertoire with many physical and functional similarities to humans. This paper reviews what is known about these facial expression repertoires, discusses the importance of social organization in understanding the meaning of different expressions, and introduces a new coding system, the ChimpFACS, and describes how it can be used to determine homologies between human and chimpanzee facial expressions. Finally, it reviews previous studies on the categorization of facial expressions by chimpanzees using computerized tasks, and discusses the importance of configural processing for this skill in both humans and chimpanzees. Future directions for understanding the evolution of emotional communication will include studies on the social function of facial expressions in ongoing social interactions, the development of facial expression communication and more studies that examine the perception of these important social signals.},

	Abstract = {Several minerals and trace elements are essential for normal thyroid hormone metabolism, e.g., iodine, iron, selenium, and zinc. Coexisting deficiencies of these elements can impair thyroid function. Iron deficiency impairs thyroid hormone synthesis by reducing activity of heme-dependent thyroid peroxidase. Iron-deficiency anemia blunts and iron supplementation improves the efficacy of iodine supplementation. Combined selenium and iodine deficiency leads to myxedematous cretinism. The normal thyroid gland retains high selenium concentrations even under conditions of inadequate selenium supply and expresses many of the known selenocysteine-containing proteins. Among these selenoproteins are the glutathione peroxidase, deiodinase, and thioredoxine reductase families of enzymes. Adequate selenium nutrition supports efficient thyroid hormone synthesis and metabolism and protects the thyroid gland from damage by excessive iodide exposure. In regions of combined severe iodine and selenium deficiency, normalization of iodine supply is mandatory before initiation of selenium supplementation in order to prevent hypothyroidism. Selenium deficiency and disturbed thyroid hormone economy may develop under conditions of special dietary regimens such as long-term total parenteral nutrition, phenylketonuria diet, cystic fibrosis, or may be the result of imbalanced nutrition in children, elderly people, or sick patients.},

	Abstract = {Linear operations can only partially exploit the statistical redundancies of natural scenes, and nonlinear operations are ubiquitous in visual cortex. However, neither the detailed function of the nonlinearities nor the higher-order image statistics are yet fully understood. We suggest that these complicated issues can not be tackled by one single approach, but require a range of methods, and the understanding of the crosslinks between the results. We consider three basic approaches: (i) State space descriptions can theoretically provide complete information about statistical properties and nonlinear operations, but their practical usage is confined to very low-dimensional settings. We discuss the use of representation-related state-space coordinates (multivariate wavelet statistics) and of basic nonlinear coordinate transformations of the state space (e.g., a polar transform). (ii) Indirect methods, like unsupervised learning in multi-layer networks, provide complete optimization results, but no direct information on the statistical properties, and no simple model structures. (iii) Approximation by lower-order terms of power-series expansions is a classical strategy that has not yet received broad attention. On the statistical side, this approximation amounts to cumulant functions and higher-order spectra (polyspectra), on the processing side to Volterra Wiener systems. In this context we suggest that an important concept for the understanding of natural scene statistics, of nonlinear neurons, and of biological pattern recognition can be found in AND-like combinations of frequency components. We investigate how the different approaches can be related to each other, how they can contribute to the understanding of cortical nonlinearities such as complex cells, cortical gain control, end-stopping and other extraclassical receptive field properties, and how we can obtain a nonlinear perspective on overcomplete representations and invariant coding in visual cortex.},

@article{corneil2002a,
	Abstract = {This study addresses the integration of auditory and visual stimuli subserving the generation of saccades in a complex scene. Previous studies have shown that saccadic reaction times (SRTs) to combined auditory-visual stimuli are reduced when compared with SRTs to either stimulus alone. However, these results have been typically obtained with high-intensity stimuli distributed over a limited number of positions in the horizontal plane. It is less clear how auditory-visual interactions influence saccades under more complex but arguably more natural conditions, when low-intensity stimuli are embedded in complex backgrounds and distributed throughout two-dimensional (2-D) space. To study this problem, human subjects made saccades to visual-only (V-saccades), auditory-only (A-saccades), or spatially coincident auditory-visual (AV-saccades) targets. In each trial, the low-intensity target was embedded within a complex auditory-visual background, and subjects were allowed over 3 s to search for and foveate the target at 1 of 24 possible locations within the 2-D oculomotor range. We varied systematically the onset times of the targets and the intensity of the auditory target relative to background [i.e., the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio] to examine their effects on both SRT and saccadic accuracy. Subjects were often able to localize the target within one or two saccades, but in about 15% of the trials they generated scanning patterns that consisted of many saccades. The present study reports only the SRT and accuracy of the first saccade in each trial. In all subjects, A-saccades had shorter SRTs than V-saccades, but were more inaccurate than V-saccades when generated to auditory targets presented at low S/N ratios. AV-saccades were at least as accurate as V-saccades but were generated at SRTs typical of A-saccades. The properties of AV-saccades depended systematically on both stimulus timing and S/N ratio of the auditory target. Compared with unimodal A- and V-saccades, the improvements in SRT and accuracy of AV-saccades were greatest when the visual target was synchronous with or leading the auditory target, and when the S/N ratio of the auditory target was lowest. Further, the improvements in saccade accuracy were greater in elevation than in azimuth. A control experiment demonstrated that a portion of the improvements in SRT could be attributable to a warning-cue mechanism, but that the improvements in saccade accuracy depended on the spatial register of the stimuli. These results agree well with earlier electrophysiological results obtained from the midbrain superior colliculus (SC) of anesthetized preparations, and we argue that they demonstrate multisensory integration of auditory and visual signals in a complex, quasi-natural environment. A conceptual model incorporating the SC is presented to explain the observed data.},

	Abstract = {Each odorant receptor gene defines a unique type of olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) and a corresponding type of second-order neuron. Because each odor can activate multiple ORN types, information must ultimately be integrated across these processing channels to form a unified percept. Here, we show that, in Drosophila, integration begins at the level of second-order projection neurons (PNs). We genetically silence all the ORNs that normally express a particular odorant receptor and find that PNs postsynaptic to the silent glomerulus receive substantial lateral excitatory input from other glomeruli. Genetically confining odor-evoked ORN input to just one glomerulus reveals that most PNs postsynaptic to other glomeruli receive indirect excitatory input from the single ORN type that is active. Lateral connections between identified glomeruli vary in strength, and this pattern of connections is stereotyped across flies. Thus, a dense network of lateral connections distributes odor-evoked excitation between channels in the first brain region of the olfactory processing stream.},

	Abstract = {Neurons in the visual cortex respond selectively to perceptually salient features of the visual scene, such as the direction and speed of moving objects, the orientation of local contours, or the colour or relative depth of a visual pattern. It is commonly assumed that the brain constructs its percept of the visual scene from information encoded in the selective responses of such neurons. We have now tested this hypothesis directly by measuring the effect on psychophysical performance of modifying the firing rates of physiologically characterized neurons. We required rhesus monkeys to report the direction of motion in a visual display while we electrically stimulated clusters of directionally selective neurons in the middle temporal visual area (MT, or V5), an extrastriate area that plays a prominent role in the analysis of visual motion information. Microstimulation biased the animals' judgements towards the direction of motion encoded by the stimulated neurons. This result indicates that physiological properties measured at the neuronal level can be causally related to a specific aspect of perceptual performance.},

The acoustic and visual signals generated by the crowd provide you with complementary information about their locations and motion which needs to be integrated. It is not well understood how such inputs from different sensory channels are combined into unified perceptual states. Coherence of oscillatory neural signals might be an essential mechanism supporting multisensory perception. Evidence is now emerging which indicates that coupled oscillatory activity might serve to link neural signals across uni- and multisensory regions and to express the degree of crossmodal matching of stimulus-related information. These results argue for a new view on multisensory processing which considers the dynamic interplay of neural populations as a key to crossmodal integration.},

	Abstract = {Complex representations in sensory cortices rely on the integration of inputs that overlap temporally and spatially, particularly in supragranular layers, yet the spatiotemporal dynamics of this synaptic integration are largely unknown. The rodent somatosensory system offers an excellent opportunity to study these dynamics because of the overlapping functional representations of single-whisker inputs. We recorded responses in mouse primary somatosensory (barrel) cortex to single and paired whisker deflections using high-speed voltage-sensitive dye imaging. Responses to paired deflections at intervals of 0 and 10 ms summed sublinearly, producing a single transient smaller in amplitude than the sum of the component responses. At longer intervals of 50 and 100 ms, the response to the second deflection was reduced in amplitude and limited spatially relative to control. Between 100 and 200 ms, the response to the second deflection recovered and often showed areas of facilitation. With increasing interstimulus interval from 50 to 200 ms, recovery of the second response occurred from the second stimulated whisker's barrel column outward. In contrast to results with paired-whisker stimulation, when a whisker deflection was preceded by a weak electrical stimulus applied to the neighboring cortex, the summation of evoked responses was predominantly linear at all intervals tested. Thus under our conditions, the linearity of response summation in cortex was not predicted by the amplitudes of the component responses on a column-by-column basis, but rather by the timing and nature of the inputs.},

	Abstract = {By voluntarily directing attention to a specific region of a visual scene, we can improve our perception of stimuli at that location. This ability to focus attention upon specific zones of the visual field has been described metaphorically as a moveable spotlight or zoom lens that facilitates the processing of stimuli within its 'beam'. A long-standing controversy has centred on the question of whether the spotlight of spatial attention has a unitary beam or whether it can be divided flexibly to disparate locations. Evidence supporting the unitary spotlight view has come from numerous behavioural and electrophysiological studies. Recent experiments, however, indicate that the spotlight of spatial attention may be divided between non-contiguous zones of the visual field for very brief stimulus exposures ({\&}<100 ms). Here we use an electrophysiological measure of attentional allocation (the steady-state visual evoked potential) to show that the spotlight may be divided between spatially separated locations (excluding interposed locations) over more extended time periods. This spotlight division appears to be accomplished at an early stage of visual-cortical processing.},

	Abstract = {During the development of the mammalian retinocollicular projection, a coarse retinotopic map is set up by the graded distribution of axon guidance molecules. Subsequent refinement of the initially diffuse projection has been shown to depend on the spatially correlated firing of retinal ganglion cells. In this scheme, the abolition of patterned retinal activity is not expected to influence overall retinotopic organization, but this has not been investigated. We used optical imaging of intrinsic signals to visualize the complete retinotopic map in the superior colliculus (SC) of mice lacking early retinal waves, caused by the deletion of the \beta\2 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. As expected from previous anatomical studies in the SC of \beta\2-/- mice, regions activated by individual visual stimuli were much larger and had less sharp borders than those in wild-type mice. Importantly, however, we also found systematic distortions of the entire retinotopic map: the map of visual space was expanded anteriorly and compressed posteriorly. Thus, patterned neuronal activity in the early retina has a substantial influence on the coarse retinotopic organization of the SC.},

	Abstract = {Visual search is a fundamental and routine task of everyday life. Studying visual search promises to shed light on the basic attentional mechanisms that facilitate visual processing. To investigate visual attention during search processes, numerous studies measured the selectivity of observers' saccadic eye movements for local display features. These experiments almost entirely relied on simple, artificial displays with discrete search items and features. The present study employed complex search displays and targets to examine task-driven (top-down) visual guidance by low-level features under more natural conditions. Significant guidance by local intensity, contrast, spatial frequency, and orientation was found, and its properties such as magnitude and resolution were analyzed across dimensions. Moreover, feature-ratio effects were detected, which correspond to distractor-ratio effects in simple search displays. These results point out the limitations of current purely stimulus-driven (bottom-up) models of attention during scene perception.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate the accuracy of fixation after symmetrical vergence eye movements along the midline during natural full-field viewing conditions using a video method of eye position measurement. METHODS: The accuracy of binocular fixation after symmetrical vergence eye movements during natural conditions was measured on 29 young adults using a precise head-mounted video eye movement measuring system. All subjects had normal binocular vision and good visual acuity. Measurements were taken for both near and far fixation after vergence changes of 5 degrees, 10 degrees, and 15 degrees using three rates of change, approximately 0.25, 0.5, and 1 Hz. RESULTS: The amplitude of the vergence movement tended to be hypometric, resulting in underconvergence for near fixations, and overconvergence for distance fixation. For far fixations, most errors (82%) were from -120 to +120 min arc, and for near, most errors (85%) were from -30 to +120 min arc. For far fixations, there was a significant effect of the size of vergence change (F1,28 = 61.8; p < 0.001), the rate of change (F1,28 = 7.08; p = 0.013), and the interaction between these two factors (F1,28 = 7.17; p = 0.012) on resulting errors, with the eyes showing greater overconvergence on the target for the larger and faster fixation changes. For near fixations, there was a significant effect (F1,28 = 15.9; p < 0.001) for the angle of change with the faster vergence changes producing relatively more convergence, thus reducing the mean vergence error. No subject reported diplopia during any conditions despite our measures showing vergence errors of up to 5 degrees. CONCLUSIONS: Vergence errors of up to +/-2 degrees, without diplopia, were common in subjects with normal binocular single vision. Errors of 5 degrees were rare but present. In all, the largest number of errors occurred as a failure of divergence for far fixations, consistent with previous studies that have suggested differences in the neural control of pathways for convergence and divergence, or possibly caused by differences in the anatomical properties of the medial and lateral rectus muscles and their associated fascia. The absence of diplopia during the period of fixation could only be partly associated with the visual suppression associated with vergence eye movements that has been reported by others because it was still present after the vergence movement was completed. The natural viewing conditions in this study that included a full visual field and multiple disparities may have contributed to this effect.},

@article{murayama2009a,
	Abstract = {The computational power of single neurons is greatly enhanced by active dendritic conductances that have a large influence on their spike activity. In cortical output neurons such as the large pyramidal cells of layer 5 (L5), activation of apical dendritic calcium channels leads to plateau potentials that increase the gain of the input/output function and switch the cell to burst-firing mode. The apical dendrites are innervated by local excitatory and inhibitory inputs as well as thalamic and corticocortical projections, which makes it a formidable task to predict how these inputs influence active dendritic properties in vivo. Here we investigate activity in populations of L5 pyramidal dendrites of the somatosensory cortex in awake and anaesthetized rats following sensory stimulation using a new fibre-optic method for recording dendritic calcium changes. We show that the strength of sensory stimulation is encoded in the combined dendritic calcium response of a local population of L5 pyramidal cells in a graded manner. The slope of the stimulus-response function was under the control of a particular subset of inhibitory neurons activated by synaptic inputs predominantly in L5. Recordings from single apical tuft dendrites in vitro showed that activity in L5 pyramidal neurons disynaptically coupled via interneurons directly blocks the initiation of dendritic calcium spikes in neighbouring pyramidal neurons. The results constitute a functional description of a cortical microcircuit in awake animals that relies on the active properties of L5 pyramidal dendrites and their very high sensitivity to inhibition. The microcircuit is organized so that local populations of apical dendrites can adaptively encode bottom-up sensory stimuli linearly across their full dynamic range.},

@article{smith2006a,
	Abstract = {The response of a neuron in primary visual cortex (V1) to an optimal stimulus in its classical receptive field (CRF) can be reduced by the presence of an orthogonal mask, a phenomenon known as cross-orientation suppression. The presence of a parallel stimulus outside the CRF can have a similar effect, in this case known as surround suppression. We used a novel stimulus to probe the time course of cross-orientation suppression and found that it is very fast, starting even before the response to optimal excitatory stimuli. However, it occurs with some delay after the offset response, considered to be a measure of the earliest excitatory signals that reach the CRF. We also examined the time course of response to a stimulus presented outside the CRF and found that cross-orientation suppression begins substantially earlier than surround suppression measured in the same cells. Together, these findings suggest that cross-orientation suppression is attributable to either direct feedforward signal paths to V1 neurons or a circuit involving fast local interneurons within V1. Feedback from higher cortical areas is implicated in surround suppression, but our results make this an implausible mechanism for cross-orientation suppression. We conclude that suppression from inside and outside the CRF occur through different mechanisms.},

	Abstract = {Evoked activity in the mammalian cortex and the resulting behavioral responses exhibit a large variability to repeated presentations of the same stimulus. This study examined whether the variability can be attributed to ongoing activity. Ongoing and evoked spatiotemporal activity patterns in the cat visual cortex were measured with real-time optical imaging; local field potentials and discharges of single neurons were recorded simultaneously, by electrophysiological techniques. The evoked activity appeared deterministic, and the variability resulted from the dynamics of ongoing activity, presumably reflecting the instantaneous state of cortical networks. In spite of the large variability, evoked responses in single trials could be predicted by linear summation of the deterministic response and the preceding ongoing activity. Ongoing activity must play an important role in cortical function and cannot be ignored in exploration of cognitive processes.},

	Abstract = {Understanding the dynamics of memory change is one of the current challenges facing cognitive neuroscience. Recent animal work on memory reconsolidation shows that memories can be altered long after acquisition. When reactivated, memories can be modified and require a restabilization (reconsolidation) process. We recently extended this finding to human episodic memory by showing that memory reactivation mediates the incorporation of new information into existing memory. Here we show that the spatial context plays a unique role for this type of memory updating: Being in the same spatial context during original and new learning is both necessary and sufficient for the incorporation of new information into existing episodic memories. Memories are automatically reactivated when subjects return to an original learning context, where updating by incorporating new contents can occur. However, when in a novel context, updating of existing memories does not occur, and a new episodic memory is created instead.},

Although previous work suggested that positive feedback is necessary to maintain persistent activity, here it is demonstrated how neuronal responses can instead be maintained by a purely feedforward mechanism in which activity is passed sequentially through a chain of network states. This feedforward form of memory storage is shown to occur both in architecturally feedforward networks and in recurrent networks that nevertheless function in a feedforward manner. The networks can be tuned to be perfect integrators of their inputs or to reproduce the time-varying firing patterns observed during some working memory tasks but not easily reproduced by feedback-based attractor models. This work illustrates a mechanism for maintaining short-term memory in which both feedforward and feedback processes interact to govern network behavior.},

@article{graham2006a,
	Abstract = {To account for the spatial and temporal response properties of the retina, a number of studies have proposed that these properties serve to "whiten" the visual input. In particular, it has been argued that the sensitivity of retinal ganglion cells is matched to the spatial frequency spectrum of natural scenes, resulting in a flattened or "whitened" response spectrum across a range of frequencies. However, we argue that there are two distinct hypotheses regarding the flattening of the spectrum. The decorrelation hypothesis proposes that the magnitude of each ganglion cell tuning curve rises with spatial frequency, resulting in a flattened response spectrum for natural scene stimuli. With appropriate sampling, this scheme allows neighboring neurons to be uncorrelated with each other. The response equalization hypothesis proposes that the overall response magnitude of neurons increases with spatial frequency. The proposed goal of this model is to allow neurons with different receptive field sizes to produce the same average response to natural scenes. The response equalization hypothesis proposes an explanation for the relative gain of different ganglion cells and we show that this proposal fits well with published data. We suggest that both hypotheses are important in understanding the tuning and sensitivity of ganglion cells. However, using a simulation, both models are shown to be insufficient to explain the center-surround receptive field organization of ganglion cells. We discuss other factors, including representational sparseness, which could be related to the goals of ganglion cell spatial processing. We suggest three constraints needed to describe the basic linear properties of P-type ganglion cells: decorrelation, response equalization, and a minimal wiring or minimal size constraint.},

	Abstract = {Adaptation is a hallmark of sensory function. Adapting optimally requires matching the dynamics of adaptation to those of changes in the stimulus distribution. Here we show that the dynamics of adaptation in the responses of mouse retinal ganglion cells depend on stimulus history. We hypothesized that the accumulation of evidence for a change in the stimulus distribution controls the dynamics of adaptation, and developed a model for adaptation as an ongoing inference problem. Guided by predictions of this model, we found that the dynamics of adaptation depend on the discriminability of the change in stimulus distribution and that the retina exploits information contained in properties of the stimulus beyond the mean and variance to adapt more quickly when possible.},

	Abstract = {From the many attempts to produce a conceptual framework for the organization of living systems, the notions of (M,R) systems and Autopoiesis stand out for their rigor, their presupposition of the circularity of metabolism, and the new epistemologies that they imply. From their inceptions, these two notions have been essentially disconnected because each has defined its own language and tools. Here we demonstrate the existence of a deep conceptual link between (M,R) systems and Autopoietic systems. This relationship permits us to posit that Autopoietic systems, which have been advanced as capturing the central aspects of living systems, are a subset of (M,R) systems. This result, in conjunction with previous theorems proved by Rosen, can be used to outline a demonstration that the operation of Autopoietic systems cannot be simulated by Turing machines. This powerful result shows the potential of linking these two models. Finally, we suggest that the formalism of (M,R) systems could be used to model the circularity of metabolism.},

	Abstract = {The prevailing hierarchical model of cortical sensory processing holds that early processing is specific to individual modalities and that combination of information from different modalities is deferred until higher-order stages of processing. In this paper, we present physiological evidence of multisensory convergence at an early stage of cortical auditory processing. We used multi-neuron cluster recordings, along with a limited sample of single-unit recordings, to determine whether neurons in the macaque auditory cortex respond to cutaneous stimulation. We found coextensive cutaneous and auditory responses in caudomedial auditory cortex, an area lying adjacent to A1, and at the second stage of the auditory cortical hierarchy. Somatosensory-auditory convergence in auditory cortex may underlie effects observed in human studies. Convergence of inputs from different sensory modalities at very early stages of cortical sensory processing has important implications for both our developing understanding of multisensory processing and established views of unisensory processing.},

I propose a model of contextual cueing for attention guidance based onthe global scene configuration. It is shown that the statistics of low-level features across the whole image can be used to prime the presence or absence of objects in the scene and to predict their location, scale, and appearance before exploring the image. In this scheme, visual context information can become available early in the visual processing chain, which allows modulation of the saliency of image regions and provides an efficient shortcut for object detection and recognition.},

	Abstract = {We assessed the effects of dose, regimen and duration of anti-thyroid drug therapy for Graves' thyrotoxicosis on recurrence of hyperthyroidism, course of ophthalmopathy, adverse effects, health-related quality of life and economic outcomes. We undertook a systematic review and meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We identified RCTs regardless of language or publication status by searching six databases, and trial registries. Dual, blinded data abstraction and quality assessment were undertaken. Trials included provided therapy for at least 6 months with follow-up at least 1 year after drug cessation. Fixed or random effects meta-analyses were used to combine study data. Twelve trials compared a Block-Replace regimen (requiring a higher dose of anti-thyroid drug treatment) with a Titration regimen. Overall, there was no significant difference between the regimens for relapse of hyperthyroidism (relative risk (RR) = 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84 to 1.03). Participants were more likely to withdraw due to adverse events with a Block-Replace regimen (RR = 1.89, 95% CI 1.25 to 2.85). Prescribing replacement thyroxine, either with the anti-thyroid drug treatment, or after this was completed, had no significant effect on relapse. Limited evidence suggested 12-18 months of anti-thyroid drug treatment should be used. The titration regimen appeared as effective as the Block-Replace regimen, and was associated with fewer adverse effects. However, relapse rates over 50% and high participant drop-out rates in trials mean that the results should be interpreted with caution, and may suggest that other strategies for the management of Graves' disease, such as radioiodine, should be considered more frequently as first-line therapy. There were no data on the course of ophthalmopathy, health-related quality of life and economic outcomes.},

This suggests that aspects of olfactory processing may differ fundamentally from processing in other sensory modalities. This review summarizes current understanding of early events in olfactory processing. We focus on how odors are encoded by the activity of primary olfactory receptor neurons, how odor codes may be transformed in the olfactory bulb, and what relevance these codes may have for downstream neurons in higher brain centers. Recent findings in synaptic physiology, neural coding, and psychophysics are discussed, with reference to both vertebrate and insect model systems.},

	Abstract = {This study examined spatial vision and attentional selection using a gaze-contingent multiresolutional display, with a dynamic, gaze-centered, high-resolution window and lower resolution periphery. Visual search times and eye movements from 15 participants in a 3 x 3 design (Window Radius x Peripheral Resolution) suggest that contrast sensitivity as a function of retinal eccentricity affects attentional selection and visual processing. Smaller windows led to longer search times and shorter saccades; lower peripheral resolution also shortened saccades (all ps < .05) as a result of avoiding fixating degraded areas. Fixation durations, although longer for smaller windows (p < .05), were unaffected by whether the next saccade went within or outside the window. These results are explained through (a) competition among potential saccade targets where above-threshold filtering reduces an object's relative salience and (b) generally disrupted visual processing.},

	Abstract = {We have used optical imaging of intrinsic signals to visualize the retinotopic organization of mouse visual cortex. The functionally determined position, size, and shape of area 17 corresponded precisely to the location of this area as seen in stained cortical sections. The retinotopic map, which was confirmed with electrophysiological recordings, exhibited very low inter-animal variability, thus allowing averaging of maps across animals. Patches of activity in area 17 were often encircled by regions in which the intrinsic signal dropped below baseline, suggesting the presence of strong surround inhibition. Single-unit recordings revealed that this decrease of the intrinsic signal indeed correlated with a drop of neuronal firing rate below baseline. The averaged maps also greatly facilitated the identification of extrastriate visual activity, pointing to at least four extrastriate visual areas in the mouse. We conclude that optical imaging is ideally suited to visualize retinotopic maps in mice, thus making this a powerful technique for the analysis of map structure in transgenic animals.},

@article{calvert2001c,
	Abstract = {Electrophysiological studies in nonhuman primates and other mammals have shown that sensory cues from different modalities that appear at the same time and in the same location can increase the firing rate of multisensory cells in the superior colliculus to a level exceeding that predicted by summing the responses to the unimodal inputs. In contrast, spatially disparate multisensory cues can induce a profound response depression. We have previously demonstrated using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) that similar indices of crossmodal facilitation and inhibition are detectable in human cortex when subjects listen to speech while viewing visually congruent and incongruent lip and mouth movements. Here, we have used fMRI to investigate whether similar BOLD signal changes are observable during the crossmodal integration of nonspeech auditory and visual stimuli, matched or mismatched solely on the basis of their temporal synchrony, and if so, whether these crossmodal effects occur in similar brain areas as those identified during the integration of audio-visual speech. Subjects were exposed to synchronous and asynchronous auditory (white noise bursts) and visual (B/W alternating checkerboard) stimuli and to each modality in isolation. Synchronous and asynchronous bimodal inputs produced superadditive BOLD response enhancement and response depression across a large network of polysensory areas. The most highly significant of these crossmodal gains and decrements were observed in the superior colliculi. Other regions exhibiting these crossmodal interactions included cortex within the superior temporal sulcus, intraparietal sulcus, insula, and several foci in the frontal lobe, including within the superior and ventromedial frontal gyri. These data demonstrate the efficacy of using an analytic approach informed by electrophysiology to identify multisensory integration sites in humans and suggest that the particular network of brain areas implicated in these crossmodal integrative processes are dependent on the nature of the correspondence between the different sensory inputs (e.g. space, time, and/or form).},

	Abstract = {Eye movements (EMs) are an important aspect of human visual behavior. The temporal and space-variant nature of sampling a visual scene requires frequent attentional gaze shifts (saccades) to fixate onto different parts of an image. Fixations are often directed toward the most informative regions in the visual scene. We introduce a model and its simulation that can select such regions based on prior knowledge of similar scenes. Having representations of scenes as a probabilistic combination of regions with certain properties, it is possible to assess the likely contribution of each region in the successive recognition process. Using Bayesian conditional probabilities for each region given the scene category, the model can then predict the informative value of that region and initiate a spatial information-gathering algorithm analogous to an EM saccade to a new fixation},

Available functions include EEG data, channel and event information importing, data visualization (scrolling, scalp map and dipole model plotting, plus multi-trial ERP-image plots), preprocessing (including artifact rejection, filtering, epoch selection, and averaging), independent component analysis (ICA) and time/frequency decompositions including channel and component cross-coherence supported by bootstrap statistical methods based on data resampling. EEGLAB functions are organized into three layers. Top-layer functions allow users to interact with the data through the graphic interface without needing to use MATLAB syntax. Menu options allow users to tune the behavior of EEGLAB to available memory. Middle-layer functions allow users to customize data processing using command history and interactive 'pop' functions. Experienced MATLAB users can use EEGLAB data structures and stand-alone signal processing functions to write custom and/or batch analysis scripts. Extensive function help and tutorial information are included. A 'plug-in' facility allows easy incorporation of new EEG modules into the main menu. EEGLAB is freely available (http://www.sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/) under the GNU public license for noncommercial use and open source development, together with sample data, user tutorial and extensive documentation.},

	Abstract = {EEG oscillations are hypothesized to reflect cyclical variations in the neuronal excitability, with particular frequency bands reflecting differing spatial scales of brain operation. However, despite decades of clinical and scientific investigation, there is no unifying theory of EEG organization, and the role of ongoing activity in sensory processing remains controversial. This study analyzed laminar profiles of synaptic activity [current source density CSD] and multiunit activity (MUA), both spontaneous and stimulus-driven, in primary auditory cortex of awake macaque monkeys. Our results reveal that the EEG is hierarchically organized; delta (1-4 Hz) phase modulates theta (4-10 Hz) amplitude, and theta phase modulates gamma (30-50 Hz) amplitude. This oscillatory hierarchy controls baseline excitability and thus stimulus-related responses in a neuronal ensemble. We propose that the hierarchical organization of ambient oscillatory activity allows auditory cortex to structure its temporal activity pattern so as to optimize the processing of rhythmic inputs.},

@article{hassan2008a,
	Abstract = {Background To evaluate the effect of Lugol's Iodine (LI) on angiogenic characteristics and postthyroidectomy morbidity in patients with Graves' Disease (GD). Methods Medical records of 153 patients, who underwent thyroidectomies for GD between 1987 and 2006 were reviewed. LI in addition to antithyroid drugs (ATD) was administered to 16 toxic Graves' cases (group I), while 137 received ATD only (group II). In order to evaluate thyroid vascularity, immunohistochemical staining (IHS) for VEGF and CD31 for assessing microvessel density (MVD) were performed in group I, 20 random cases of group II, and 7 stochastic patients with non-toxic goiter (group III). Results Early postoperative complications were significantly higher in group I compared to group II: (transient recurrent nerve palsy (P < 0.04), transient hypocalcemia (P < 0.02), and postoperative bleeding (P < 0.003)). Meanwhile permanent complications were not significantly different. VEGF-IHS revealed ten patients of group I (62.5%) to have positive staining compared to only 3 (15%) of group II. All patients of group III stained positive. The expression of VEGF was more intense in group I as compared to group II (P < 0.02). However, no significant difference of MVD among all groups was recorded. Conclusion Preoperative LI treatment may be associated with increased early postoperative morbidity and did not affect thyroid vascularity.},

The spatially localized target and masks enabled investigation of space dependent lateral interactions between foveal and neighboring spatial channels. Our data show a suppressive region extending to a radius of two wavelengths, in which the presence of the masking signals have the effect of increasing target threshold. Beyond this range a much larger facilitatory region (up to a distance of ten wavelengths) is indicated, in which contrast thresholds were found to decrease by up to a factor of two. The interactions between the foveal target and the flanking Gabor signals are spatial-frequency and orientation specific in both regions, but less specific in the suppression region.},

	Abstract = {Humans can recognize the gist of a novel image in a single glance, independent of its complexity. How is this remarkable feat accomplished? On the basis of behavioral and computational evidence, this paper describes a formal approach to the representation and the mechanism of scene gist understanding, based on scene-centered, rather than object-centered primitives. We show that the structure of a scene image can be estimated by the mean of global image features, providing a statistical summary of the spatial layout properties (Spatial Envelope representation) of the scene. Global features are based on configurations of spatial scales and are estimated without invoking segmentation or grouping operations. The scene-centered approach is not an alternative to local image analysis but would serve as a feed-forward and parallel pathway of visual processing, able to quickly constrain local feature analysis and enhance object recognition in cluttered natural scenes.},

@article{howarth2009a,
	Abstract = {Prolonged viewing of an unchanging pattern causes adaptation, which can be demonstrated by visual aftereffects such as the tilt and waterfall illusions. In normal observers, these typically exhibit interocular transfer (IOT), being observed when the adapting and test stimuli are shown to different eyes. Convergence of inputs from both eyes upon binocular neurons only occurs in the primary visual cortex (V1), and adaptation is substantially a cortical phenomenon. However, little is known about a physiological substrate of IOT in V1 and how it relates to the binocularity of neurons and local ocular dominance (OD) column architecture. We employed optical imaging to obtain OD maps in cat V1 and recorded from single neurons at targeted penetration sites to quantify their adaptation by drifting gratings when adapter and test stimulus were presented either to the same or to the opposite eyes. In contrast to earlier reports, clear IOT of adaptation was observed for binocular as well as monocular neurons; at population level, its strength amounted to 55%. Moreover, the position of the cells with respect to OD column borders had no significant effect on the strength of IOT. IOT does not appear to strongly depend on conventional binocularity of neurons.},

	Abstract = {Perceptual organization or grouping is one of the central issues in vision research. Recent reports in the neuroimaging literature suggest that perceptual organization is mediated by distributed visual areas that range from the primary visual cortex (V1) to higher visual areas, depending on the availability of grouping cues and on the weight of contribution of each visual area. Evidence suggests that grouping by proximity and collinearity, and also perhaps filling-in, involve V1, whereas grouping by similarity and symmetry seems to depend on activation of higher visual areas. Further studies should include deliberate controls for confounding factors such as attentional artifacts and radial orientation bias, to clarify how spatiotemporal information in visual areas is integrated to give rise to perceptual organization.},

	Abstract = {Viewing a distorted face induces large aftereffects in the appearance of an undistorted face. The authors examined the processes underlying this adaptation by comparing how selective the aftereffects are for different dimensions of the images including size, spatial frequency content, contrast, and color. Face aftereffects had weaker selectivity for changes in the size, contrast, or color of the images and stronger selectivity for changes in contrast polarity or spatial frequency. This pattern could arise if the adaptation is contingent on the perceived similarity of the stimuli as faces. Consistent with this, changing contrast polarity or spatial frequency had larger effects on the perceived identity of a face, and aftereffects were also selective for different individual faces. These results suggest that part of the sensitivity changes underlying the adaptation may arise at visual levels closely associated with the representation of faces.},

	Abstract = {Most neurons in cat striate visual cortex show inhibitory effects when moving contours are presented beyond the limits of classic receptive field regions. Facilitatory effects are also present in about 40% of simple cells. Here, we report a highly specific form of this facilitation, mediated only by neurons possessing both an orientation tuning matched to the test unit, and a receptive field position aligned with its long axis. This finding illustrates one of the intracortical interconnection schemes hypothesized by Mitchison and Crick (1982). Periodic clustering in long, intrinsic axons may signify a neuron seeking specific functional interactions like these across columnar systems in both the spatial and orientation domains.},

	Abstract = {Top-down informativeness elaboration and bottom-up conspicuity processing are intimately interconnected in visual perception. An internal cognitive model of the external world must necessarily control not only our recognition but also the scanpath sequence of eye movement/shift of attention jumps. A self-organizing process based on principal component analysis and scanpath experimental data are used in this paper to define spatial visual conspicuity from the eigen-features of the scanpath sequence image loci. Eight different classes of images are used as both training and testing set. We first demonstrate that cognitive-driven scanpath loci can be discriminated in terms of these bottom-up eigen conspicuity features. We can finally define a conspicuity processing algorithm and measure its ability to predict human scanpaths as evidenced by the positional similarity measure Sp. Some computer vision applications will also be discussed.},

	Abstract = {Neocortical assemblies produce complex activity patterns both in response to sensory stimuli and spontaneously without sensory input. To investigate the structure of these patterns, we recorded from populations of 40-100 neurons in auditory and somatosensory cortices of anesthetized and awake rats using silicon microelectrodes. Population spike time patterns were broadly conserved across multiple sensory stimuli and spontaneous events. Although individual neurons showed timing variations between stimuli, these were not sufficient to disturb a generally conserved sequential organization observed at the population level, lasting for approximately 100 ms with spiking reliability decaying progressively after event onset. Preserved constraints were also seen in population firing rate vectors, with vectors evoked by individual stimuli occupying subspaces of a larger but still constrained space outlined by the set of spontaneous events. These results suggest that population spike patterns are drawn from a limited "vocabulary," sampled widely by spontaneous events but more narrowly by sensory responses.},

	Abstract = {The visual system utilizes binocular disparity to discriminate the relative depth of objects in space. Since the striate cortex is the first site along the central visual pathways at which signals from the left and right eyes converge onto a single neuron, encoding of binocular disparity is thought to begin in this region. There are two possible mechanisms for encoding binocular disparity through simple cells in the striate cortex: a difference in receptive field (RF) position between the two eyes (RF position disparity) and a difference in RF profile between the two eyes (RF phase disparity). Although there have been studies supporting each of the two encoding mechanisms, both mechanisms have not been examined in a single study. Therefore, the relative roles of the two mechanisms have not been determined. To address this issue, we have mapped left and right eye RFs of simple cells in the cat's striate cortex using binary m-sequence noise, and then we have estimated RF position and phase disparities. We find that RF position disparities are generally limited to small values that are not sufficient to encode large binocular disparities. In contrast, RF phase disparities cover a wide range of binocular disparities and exhibit dependencies on orientation and spatial frequency in a manner expected for a mechanism that encodes binocular disparity. These results indicate that binocular disparity is mainly encoded through RF phase disparity. However, RF position disparity may play a significant role for cells with high spatial frequency selectivity, which are constrained to small RF phase disparities.},

	Abstract = {Voltage-sensitive dye imaging resolves the spatiotemporal dynamics of supragranular subthreshold cortical activity with millisecond temporal resolution and subcolumnar spatial resolution. We used a flexible fiber optic image bundle to visualize voltage-sensitive dye dynamics in the barrel cortex of freely moving mice while simultaneously filming whisker-related behavior to generate two movies matched frame-by-frame with a temporal resolution of up to 2 ms. Sensory responses evoked by passive whisker stimulation lasted longer and spread further across the barrel cortex in awake mice compared to anesthetized mice. Passively evoked sensory responses were large during behaviorally quiet periods and small during active whisking. However, as an exploring mouse approached an object while whisking, large-amplitude, propagating cortical sensory activity was evoked by active whisker-touch. These experiments demonstrate that fiber optics can be used to image cortical sensory activity with high resolution in freely moving animals. The results demonstrate differential processing of sensory input depending upon behavior.},

These observations will be important for understanding how neuronal ensembles produce a system that perceives, remembers, and adapts to injury. The advantage to being able to observe changes at early stages in a sensory pathway is that one may be able to understand the way in which neuronal ensembles encode and represent images at the level of their receptive field properties, of cortical topographies, and of the patterns of connections between cells participating in a network.},

	Abstract = {Spiral waves are a basic feature of excitable systems. Although such waves have been observed in a variety of biological systems, they have not been observed in the mammalian cortex during neuronal activity. Here, we report stable rotating spiral waves in rat neocortical slices visualized by voltage-sensitive dye imaging. Tissue from the occipital cortex (visual) was sectioned parallel to cortical lamina to preserve horizontal connections in layers III-V (500-mum-thick, approximately 4 x 6 mm(2)). In such tangential slices, excitation waves propagated in two dimensions during cholinergic oscillations. Spiral waves occurred spontaneously and alternated with plane, ring, and irregular waves. The rotation rate of the spirals was approximately 10 turns per second, and the rotation was linked to the oscillations in a one-cycle- one-rotation manner. A small (<128 mum) phase singularity occurred at the center of the spirals, about which were observed oscillations of widely distributed phases. The phase singularity drifted slowly across the tissue ( approximately 1 mm/10 turns). We introduced a computational model of a cortical layer that predicted and replicated many of the features of our experimental findings. We speculate that rotating spiral waves may provide a spatial framework to organize cortical oscillations.},

	Abstract = {The spiking response of a primary visual cortical cell to a stimulus placed within its receptive field can be up- and down-regulated by the simultaneous presentation of objects or scenes placed in the "silent" regions which surround the receptive field. We here review recent progresses that have been made both at the experimental and theoretical levels in the description of these so-called "Center/Surround" modulations and in the understanding of their neural basis. Without denying the role of a modulatory feedback from higher cortical areas, recent results support the view that some of these phenomena result from the dynamic interplay between feedforward projections and horizontal intracortical connectivity in V1. Uncovering the functional role of the contextual periphery of cortical receptive fields has become an area of active investigation. The detailed comparison of electrophysiological and psychophysical data reveals strong correlations between the integrative behavior of V1 cells and some aspects of "low-level" and "mid-level" conscious perception. These suggest that as early as the V1 stage, the visual system is able to make use of contextual cues to recover local visual scene properties or correct their interpretation. Promising ideas have emerged on the importance of such a strategy for the coding of visual scenes, and the processing of static and moving objects.},

	Abstract = {On the 30th anniversary of Premack and Woodruff's seminal paper asking whether chimpanzees have a theory of mind, we review recent evidence that suggests in many respects they do, whereas in other respects they might not. Specifically, there is solid evidence from several different experimental paradigms that chimpanzees understand the goals and intentions of others, as well as the perception and knowledge of others. Nevertheless, despite several seemingly valid attempts, there is currently no evidence that chimpanzees understand false beliefs. Our conclusion for the moment is, thus, that chimpanzees understand others in terms of a perception-goal psychology, as opposed to a full-fledged, human-like belief-desire psychology.},

	Abstract = {Although much traditional sensory research has studied each sensory modality in isolation, there has been a recent explosion of interest in causal interplay between different senses. Various techniques have now identified numerous multisensory convergence zones in the brain. Some convergence may arise surprisingly close to low-level sensory-specific cortex, and some direct connections may exist even between primary sensory cortices. A variety of multisensory phenomena have now been reported in which sensory-specific brain responses and perceptual judgments concerning one sense can be affected by relations with other senses. We survey recent progress in this multisensory field, foregrounding human studies against the background of invasive animal work and highlighting possible underlying mechanisms. These include rapid feedforward integration, possible thalamic influences, and/or feedback from multisensory regions to sensory-specific brain areas. Multisensory interplay is more prevalent than classic modular approaches assumed, and new methods are now available to determine the underlying circuits.},

We can now image single molecules controlling cell differentiation, growth and death; single cells and their neurites processing electrical inputs and sending outputs; neuronal circuits performing neural computations in vitro; and the intact brain. At present, imaging based on voltage-sensitive dyes (VSDI) offers the highest spatial and temporal resolution for imaging neocortical functions in the living brain, and has paved the way for a new era in the functional imaging of cortical dynamics. It has facilitated the exploration of fundamental mechanisms that underlie neocortical development, function and plasticity at the fundamental level of the cortical column.},

	Abstract = {Voltage-sensitive dyes (VSDs) and optical imaging are useful for studying spatiotemporal patterns of population neuronal activity in cortical tissue. Using a photodiode array and absorption dyes we were able to detect neuronal activity in single trials before it could be detected by local field potential (LFP) recordings. Simultaneous electrical and optical recordings from the same tissue also showed that VSD and LFP signals have different waveforms during different activities, suggesting that they are sensitive to different aspects of the synchronization across the population. Noise, dye bleaching, phototoxicity and optical filter selection are important to the quality of the VSD signal and are discussed in this report. With optimized signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) and total recording time, we can optically monitor approximately 500 locations in an area of 1 mm(2) of cortical tissue with a sensitivity comparable to that of LFP electrodes. The total recording time and S/N of fluorescence and absorption dyes are also compared. At S/N of 8-10, absorption dye NK3630 allows a total recording time of 15-30 min, which can be divided into hundreds of 4-8 s recording trials over several hours, long enough for many kinds of experiments. In conclusion, the VSD method provides a reliable way for examining neuronal activity and pharmacological properties of synapses in brain slices.},

	Abstract = {Primary visual coding can be characterized by the receptive field (RF) properties of single neurons. Subject of this paper is our search for a global, second coding step beyond the RF-concept that links related features in a visual scene. In recent models of visual coding, oscillatory activities have been proposed to constitute such linking signals. We tested the neurophysiological relevance of this hypothesis for the visual system. Single and multiple spikes as well as local field potentials were recorded simultaneously from several locations in the primary visual cortex (A17 and A18) using 7 or 19 individually advanceable fiber-microelectrodes (250 or 330 microns apart). Stimulus-evoked (SE)-resonances of 35-85 Hz were found in these three types of signals throughout the visual cortex when the primary coding channels were activated by their specific stimuli. Stimulus position, orientation, movement direction and velocity, ocularity and stationary flicker caused specific SE-resonances. Coherent SE-resonances were found at distant cortical positions when at least one of the primary coding properties was similar. Coherence was found 1) within a vertical cortex column, 2) between neighbouring hypercolumns, and 3) between two different cortical areas. We assume that the coherence of SE-resonances is mediated by recurrent excitatory intra- and inter-areal connections via phase locking between assemblies that represent the linking features of the actual visual scene. Visually related activities are, thus, transiently labelled by a temporal code that signalizes their momentary association.},

	Abstract = {We perceive our own body and the world surrounding us via multiple sources of sensory information derived from several modalities, including vision, touch and audition. To enable interactions with the environment this information has to converge into a coherent and unambiguous multimodal percept of the body and the world. But how does the brain come up with such a unique percept? In this chapter I review a model that in the statistical sense describes an optimal integration mechanism. The benefit of integrating sensory information comes from a reduction in variance of the final perceptual estimate. Furthermore, I point out how this integration scheme can be incorporated in a larger framework using Bayesian decision theory (BDT).},

	Abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging adaptation (fMRIa) is an increasingly popular method that aims to provide insight into the functional properties of subpopulations of neurons within an imaging voxel. The technique relies on the assumption that neural adaptation reduces activity when two successive stimuli activate the same subpopulation but not when they stimulate different subpopulations. Here, we assess the validity of fMRIa by comparing single-cell recordings with functional imaging of orientation, motion and face processing. We find that fMRIa provides novel insight into neural representations in the human brain. However, network responses in general and adaptation in particular are more complex than is often assumed, and an unequivocal interpretation of fMRIa results can be achieved only with great care.},

@article{stanford2005a,
	Abstract = {It is well established that superior colliculus (SC) multisensory neurons integrate cues from different senses; however, the mechanisms responsible for producing multisensory responses are poorly understood. Previous studies have shown that spatially congruent cues from different modalities (e.g., auditory and visual) yield enhanced responses and that the greatest relative enhancements occur for combinations of the least effective modality-specific stimuli. Although these phenomena are well documented, little is known about the mechanisms that underlie them, because no study has systematically examined the operation that multisensory neurons perform on their modality-specific inputs. The goal of this study was to evaluate the computations that multisensory neurons perform in combining the influences of stimuli from two modalities. The extracellular activities of single neurons in the SC of the cat were recorded in response to visual, auditory, and bimodal visual-auditory stimulation. Each neuron was tested across a range of stimulus intensities and multisensory responses evaluated against the null hypothesis of simple summation of unisensory influences. We found that the multisensory response could be superadditive, additive, or subadditive but that the computation was strongly dictated by the efficacies of the modality-specific stimulus components. Superadditivity was most common within a restricted range of near-threshold stimulus efficacies, whereas for the majority of stimuli, response magnitudes were consistent with the linear summation of modality-specific influences. In addition to providing a constraint for developing models of multisensory integration, the relationship between response mode and stimulus efficacy emphasizes the importance of considering stimulus parameters when inducing or interpreting multisensory phenomena.},

	Abstract = {Speech perception can use not only auditory signals, but also visual information from seeing the speaker's mouth. The relative timing and relative location of auditory and visual inputs are both known to influence crossmodal integration psychologically, but previous imaging studies of audiovisual speech focused primarily on just temporal aspects. Here we used Positron Emission Tomography (PET) during audiovisual speech processing to study how temporal and spatial factors might jointly affect brain activations. In agreement with previous work, synchronous versus asynchronous audiovisual speech yielded increased activity in multisensory association areas (e.g., superior temporal sulcus [STS]), plus in some unimodal visual areas. Our orthogonal manipulation of relative stimulus position (auditory and visual stimuli presented at same location vs. opposite sides) and stimulus synchrony showed that (i) ventral occipital areas and superior temporal sulcus were unaffected by relative location; (ii) lateral and dorsal occipital areas were selectively activated for synchronous bimodal stimulation at the same external location; (iii) right inferior parietal lobule was activated for synchronous auditory and visual stimuli at different locations, that is, in the condition classically associated with the 'ventriloquism effect' (shift of perceived auditory position toward the visual location). Thus, different brain regions are involved in different aspects of audiovisual integration. While ventral areas appear more affected by audiovisual synchrony (which can influence speech identification), more dorsal areas appear to be associated with spatial multisensory interactions.},

	Abstract = {The nervous system must observe a complex world and produce appropriate, sometimes complex, behavioral responses. In contrast to this complexity, neural responses are often characterized through very simple descriptions such as receptive fields or tuning curves. Do these characterizations adequately reflect the true dimensionality reduction that takes place in the nervous system, or are they merely convenient oversimplifications? Here we address this question for the target-selective descending neurons (TSDNs) of the dragonfly. Using extracellular multielectrode recordings of a population of TSDNs, we quantify the completeness of the receptive field description of these cells and conclude that the information in independent instantaneous position and velocity receptive fields accounts for 70%-90% of the total information in single spikes. Thus, we demonstrate that this simple receptive field model is close to a complete description of the features in the stimulus that evoke TSDN response.},

	Abstract = {Although much is known about the sources and modulatory effects of top-down attentional signals, the information capacity of these signals is less known. Here, we investigate the granularity of top-down attentional signals. Previous theories in psychophysics have provided conflicting evidence on whether top-down guidance is coarse grained (i.e., one gain control term per feature dimension) or fine grained (i.e., multiple gain control terms per dimension). We resolve the conflict by designing new experiments that disentangle top-down from bottom-up contributions, thereby avoiding confounds existing in previous studies. The results of our eye-tracking experiments show that subjects can selectively saccade to items belonging to the relevant feature interval compared with irrelevant intervals within a dimension. This suggests that top-down signals can specify not only the relevant feature dimension but also the relevant feature interval within a dimension. We conclude that top-down signals are fine grained and can specify multiple gain control terms per dimension.},

We show that such effects emerge naturally when perception is viewed as a probabilistic inference process governed by Bayesian principles and implemented in hierarchical cortical networks. The proposed model can explain a rich variety of attention-related responses in cortical area V4 including multiplicative modulation of tuning curves, restoration of neural responses in the presence of distracting stimuli, and influence of attention on neighboring unattended locations. Our results suggest a new interpretation of attention as a cortical mechanism for reducing perceptual uncertainty by combining top-down task-relevant information with bottom-up sensory inputs in a probabilistic manner.},

@article{das1999a,
	Abstract = {Neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) respond differently to a simple visual element presented in isolation from when it is embedded within a complex image. This difference, a specific modulation by surrounding elements in the image, is mediated by short- and long-range connections within V1 and by feedback from other areas. Here we study the role of short-range connections in this process, and relate it to the layout of local inhomogeneities in the cortical maps of orientation and space. By measuring correlation between neuron pairs located in optically imaged maps of V1 orientation columns we show that the strength of local connections between cells is a graded function of lateral separation across cortex, largely radially symmetrical and relatively independent of orientation preferences. We then show the contextual influence of flanking visual elements on neuronal responses varies systematically with a neuron's position within the cortical orientation map. The strength of this contextual influence on a neuron can be predicted from a model of local connections based on simple overlap with particular features of the orientation map. This indicates that local intracortical circuitry could endow neurons with a graded specialization for processing angular visual features such as corners and T junctions, and this specialization could have its own functional cortical map, linked with the orientation map.},

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of acute zinc administration on TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone), FT3 (free triiodothyronine), and FT4 (free tetraiodothyronine) in 10 healthy individuals and 12 hyperthyroid patients with Graves' disease. All these individuals were studied following 25 mg Zn(++) administered intravenously, at 7:00 a.m. after 12 h fast. Blood samples collected at 0, 3, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after zinc administration showed no significant alteration in the plasma levels of TSH, FT3, and FT4 in hyperthyroid patients. There were no changes in the plasma levels of FT3 and FT4 in the control subjects, but TSH levels were acutely depressed by zinc administration. This study suggests that zinc given acutely and in pharmacological doses does not affect thyroid function in hyperthyroid subjects, but affect plasma TSH levels in healthy individuals.},

However, the question of how to formally model contextual influences is still open.

The model comprises 2 parallel pathways; one pathway computes local features (saliency) and the other computes global (scene-centered) features. The contextual guidance model of attention combines bottom-up saliency, scene context, and top-down mechanisms at an early stage of visual processing and predicts the image regions likely to be fixated by human observers performing natural search tasks in real-world scenes.},

	Abstract = {The synchronous occurrence of the unisensory components of a multisensory stimulus contributes to their successful merging into a coherent perceptual representation. Oscillatory gamma-band responses (GBRs, 30-80 Hz) have been linked to feature integration mechanisms and to multisensory processing, suggesting they may also be sensitive to the temporal alignment of multisensory stimulus components. Here we examined the effects on early oscillatory GBR brain activity of varying the precision of the temporal synchrony of the unisensory components of an audio-visual stimulus. Audio-visual stimuli were presented with stimulus onset asynchronies ranging from -125 to +125 ms. Randomized streams of auditory (A), visual (V), and audio-visual (AV) stimuli were presented centrally while subjects attended to either the auditory or visual modality to detect occasional targets. GBRs to auditory and visual components of multisensory AV stimuli were extracted for five subranges of asynchrony (e.g., A preceded by V by 100+/-25 ms, by 50+/-25 ms, etc.) and compared with GBRs to unisensory control stimuli. Robust multisensory interactions were observed in the early GBRs when the auditory and visual stimuli were presented with the closest synchrony. These effects were found over medial-frontal brain areas after 30-80 ms and over occipital brain areas after 60-120 ms. A second integration effect, possibly reflecting the perceptual separation of the two sensory inputs, was found over occipital areas when auditory inputs preceded visual by 100+/-25 ms. No significant interactions were observed for the other subranges of asynchrony. These results show that the precision of temporal synchrony can have an impact on early cross-modal interactions in human cortex.},

	Abstract = {Brains adapt to new situations by retuning their neurons. The most common form of neuronal adaptation, typically observed with repetitive stimulations of passive sensory organs, is depression (responses gradually decrease until stabilized). We studied cortical adaptation when stimuli are acquired by active movements of the sensory organ. In anesthetized rats, artificial whisking was induced at 5 Hz, and activity of individual neurons in layers 2-5 was recorded during whisking in air (Whisking condition) and whisking against an object (Touch condition). Response strengths were assessed by spike counts. Input-layer responses (layers 4 and 5a) usually facilitated during the whisking train, whereas superficial responses (layer 2/3) usually depressed. In layers 2/3 and 4, but not 5a, responses were usually stronger during touch trials than during whisking in air. Facilitations were specific to the protraction phase; during retraction, responses depressed in all layers and conditions. These dynamic processes were accompanied by a slow positive wave of activity progressing from superficial to deeper layers and lasting for approximately 1 s, during the transient phase of response. Our results indicate that, in the cortex, adaptation does not depend only on the level of activity or the frequency of its repetition but rather on the nature of the sensory information that is conveyed by that activity and on the processing layer. The input and laminar specificities observed here are consistent with the hypothesis that the paralemniscal layer 5a is involved in the processing of whisker motion, whereas the lemniscal barrels in layer 4 are involved in the processing of object identity.},

	Abstract = {The frontal eye field (FEF) participates in selecting the location of behaviorally relevant stimuli for guiding attention and eye movements. We simultaneously recorded local field potentials (LFPs) and spiking activity in the FEF of monkeys performing memory-guided saccade and covert visual search tasks. We compared visual latencies and the time course of spatially selective responses in LFPs and spiking activity. Consistent with the view that LFPs represent synaptic input, visual responses appeared first in the LFPs followed by visual responses in the spiking activity. However, spatially selective activity identifying the location of the target in the visual search array appeared in the spikes about 30 ms before it appeared in the LFPs. Because LFPs reflect dendritic input and spikes measure neuronal output in a local brain region, this temporal relationship suggests that spatial selection necessary for attention and eye movements is computed locally in FEF from spatially nonselective inputs.},

The main result is that after this stimulus driven activity period, this time spikes first get their activity modulated before LFP recordings. They conclude that becoz spikes represents the output of the neurons and the LFP the input, the spatial selection necessary for the task performance of monkey is computed within FEF. it s a nice source of information for FEF latencies also.

	Abstract = {Dendritic signal integration is one of the fundamental building blocks of information processing in the brain. Dendrites are endowed with mechanisms of nonlinear summation of synaptic inputs leading to regenerative dendritic events including local sodium, NMDA and calcium spikes. The generation of these events requires distinct spatio-temporal activation patterns of synaptic inputs. We hypothesise that the recent findings on dendritic spikes and local synaptic plasticity rules suggest clustering of common inputs along a subregion of a dendritic branch. These clusters may enable dendrites to separately threshold groups of functionally similar inputs, thus allowing single neurons to act as a superposition of many separate integrate and fire units. Ultimately, these properties expand our understanding about the computational power of neuronal networks.},

Ca spikes:
Calcium spikes are specific to the apical dendrites. They can be generated only on the apical dendrites.

They result in a change in firing mode, cell passes to bursting mode when Ca spike is activated.

Interaction with Back Propagating AP can lower the threhsold for generation

Na Spikes
they are generated by fast large amplitude depolarisations. this means that their generation is contingent upon arrival of many synchronous events.

Synapticaly evoked Na spikes are accompanied by Ca influx through NMDA receptors.

NMDA spikes
specific to basal dendrites
also activated by synchronous arrival of many spikes which removes the voltage depdendent Mg blockage.


BAP (Back Propagating AP)

they signal back to the dendrites the activity level of the neuron. It is Ca based, make all the dendrites fill with Calcium.


In the distal parts of the apical dendrites there is however no detecable change due to BAPs

the coincidence of BAP with the synaptic input is the key for spike-time-dependent plasticity.

	Abstract = {We examined the possibility that neurons or groups of neurons along the retino-cortical transmission chain have properties of tuned oscillators: To this end, we studied the resonance properties of the retino-thalamo-cortical system of anaesthetized cats by entraining responses with flicker stimuli of variable frequency (2-50 Hz). Responses were assessed from multi-unit activity (MUA) and local field potentials (LFPs) with up to four spatially segregated electrodes placed in areas 17 and 18. MUA and LFP responses were closely related, units discharging with high preference during LFP negativity. About 300 ms after flicker onset, responses stabilized and exhibited a highly regular oscillatory patterning that was surprisingly similar at different recording sites due to precise stimulus locking. Fourier transforms of these steady state oscillations showed maximal power at the inducing frequency and consistently revealed additional peaks at harmonic frequencies. The frequency-dependent amplitude changes of the fundamental and harmonic response components suggest that the retino-cortical system is entrainable into steady state oscillations over a broad frequency range and exhibits preferences for distinct frequencies in the theta- or slow alpha-range, and in the beta- and gamma-band. Concomitant activation of the mesencephalic reticular formation increased the ability of cortical cells to follow high frequency stimulation, and enhanced dramatically the amplitude of first- and second-order harmonics in the gamma-frequency range between 30 and 50 Hz. Cross-correlations computed between responses recorded simultaneously from different sites revealed pronounced synchronicity due to precise stimulus locking. These results suggest that the retino-cortical system contains broadly tuned, strongly damped oscillators which altogether exhibit at least three ranges of preferred frequencies, the relative expression of the preferences depending on the central state. These properties agree with the characteristics of oscillatory responses evoked by non-temporally modulated stimuli, and they indicate that neuronal responses along the retino-cortical transmission chain can become synchronized with precision in the millisecond range not only by intrinsic interactions, but also by temporally structured stimuli.},

	Abstract = {Optical imaging based on intrinsic signals was used to investigate the functional architecture of cat area 17 and the border between areas 17 and 18. The visual stimuli were gratings of different spatial frequencies moving at different angles, in different directions and with different speeds. In area 17 the iso-orientation domains were usually organized in patches rather than as elongated bands. Patches with different orientation preferences were arranged radially forming 'pinwheels' around 'orientation centres'. The pinwheel density was approximately 1.7-fold higher than in area 18. To explore clustering according to direction of motion, stimuli having the same orientation but moving in opposite directions were used. These two stimuli yielded very similar activity maps giving no indication of robust directionality clustering. Using near infrared light we were able to simultaneously image ocular-dominance and iso-orientation domains. A quantitative assessment of the relative strengths of the two subsystems showed that in upper cortical layers clustering according to orientation preference was three-fold stronger than clustering according to ocular dominance. The functional organization of spatial frequency was also examined. When we compared the activated regions by stimuli having different spatial frequency and moving at different velocities we observed that neurons were clustered also in these respects. We also investigated the functional architecture at the area 17/18 border and found that orientation maps at both sides of the border were not independent of each other. The map of area 17 smoothly blended into that of area 18. Similarly, the preferred spatial frequency of the neurons changed gradually over a distance of approximately 0.8 mm at the region of the area 17/18 border.},

	Abstract = {Models of attention are typically based on difference maps in low-level features but neglect higher order stimulus structure. To what extent does higher order statistics affect human attention in natural stimuli? We recorded eye movements while observers viewed unmodified and modified images of natural scenes. Modifications included contrast modulations (resulting in changes to first- and second-order statistics), as well as the addition of noise to the Fourier phase (resulting in changes to higher order statistics). We have the following findings: (1) Subjects' interpretation of a stimulus as a "natural" depiction of an outdoor scene depends on higher order statistics in a highly nonlinear, categorical fashion. (2) Confirming previous findings, contrast is elevated at fixated locations for a variety of stimulus categories. In addition, we find that the size of this elevation depends on higher order statistics and reduces with increasing phase noise. (3) Global modulations of contrast bias eye position toward high contrasts, consistent with a linear effect of contrast on fixation probability. This bias is independent of phase noise. (4) Small patches of locally decreased contrast repel eye position less than large patches of the same aggregate area, irrespective of phase noise. Our findings provide evidence that deviations from surrounding statistics, rather than contrast per se, underlie the well-established relation of contrast to fixation.},

	Abstract = {Rapid reaching to a target is generally accurate but also contains random and systematic error. Random errors result from noise in visual measurement, motor planning, and reach execution. Systematic error results from systematic changes in the mapping between the visual estimate of target location and the motor command necessary to reach the target (e.g., new spectacles, muscular fatigue). Humans maintain accurate reaching by recalibrating the visuomotor system, but no widely accepted computational model of the process exists. Given certain boundary conditions, a statistically optimal solution is a Kalman filter. We compared human to Kalman filter behavior to determine how humans take into account the statistical properties of errors and the reliability with which those errors can be measured. For most conditions, human and Kalman filter behavior was similar: Increasing measurement uncertainty caused similar decreases in recalibration rate; directionally asymmetric uncertainty caused different rates in different directions; more variation in systematic error increased recalibration rate. However, behavior differed in one respect: Inserting random error by perturbing feedback position causes slower adaptation in Kalman filters but had no effect in humans. This difference may be due to how biological systems remain responsive to changes in environmental statistics. We discuss the implications of this work.},

@article{ahissar1997a,
	Abstract = {Practising simple visual tasks leads to a dramatic improvement in performing them. This learning is specific to the stimuli used for training. We show here that the degree of specificity depends on the difficulty of the training conditions. We find that the pattern of specificities maps onto the pattern of receptive field selectivities along the visual pathway. With easy conditions, learning generalizes across orientation and retinal position, matching the spatial generalization of higher visual areas. As task difficulty increases, learning becomes more specific with respect to both orientation and position, matching the fine spatial retinotopy exhibited by lower areas. Consequently, we enjoy the benefits of learning generalization when possible, and of fine grain but specific training when necessary. The dynamics of learning show a corresponding feature. Improvement begins with easy cases (when the subject is allowed long processing times) and only subsequently proceeds to harder cases. This learning cascade implies that easy conditions guide the learning of hard ones. Taken together, the specificity and dynamics suggest that learning proceeds as a countercurrent along the cortical hierarchy. Improvement begins at higher generalizing levels, which, in turn, direct harder-condition learning to the subdomain of their lower-level inputs. As predicted by this reverse hierarchy model, learning can be effective using only difficult trials, but on condition that learning onset has previously been enabled. A single prolonged presentation suffices to initiate learning. We call this single-encounter enabling effect 'eureka'.},

	Abstract = {1. All complex cells in the cat's striate cortex exhibit gross non-linearities of spatial summation when tested with sinusoidal grating stimuli. Their responses to moving gratings of all but the lowest spatial frequencies are usually dominated by a component that is not modulated by the passage of the bars of the grating across the receptive field. They give responses to temporally modulated stationary gratings that consist mostly of even harmonics of the stimulus frequency and that vary little in amplitude or wave form as the spatial phase of the grating is varied. 2. We compared complex cells' receptive fields with their sensitivity to sinusoidal gratings of different spatial frequencies. Qualitatively, the receptive fields are usually two to five times wider than the bars of the gratings that stimulate them most effectively. Quantitatively, the receptive field profiles of complex cells are invariably broader than those predicted by Fourier synthesis of their spatial frequency tuning curves, and in particular lack predicted spatially antagonistic regions. 3. We further examined the receptive field organization of these cells, using pairs of stationary lines flashed synchronously on their receptive fields. If both lines are of the same polarity (bright or dark), complex cells respond to the paired stimulus much less well than they do to either of its component bars, unless the bars are separated by less than about one quarter of the width of the receptive field. If the lines are of opposite polarity, one bright and one dark, the opposite situation obtains: closely spaced bars elicit small responses, while paired bars of larger separation are much more effective. In either case, the results are independent in general character of the absolute positions of the stimuli within the receptive field; rather, they depend in a manner characteristic of each cell on the relative positions of the two bars. 4. The two-line interaction profile that plots the change in a complex cell's response to one bar as a function of the position of a second added bar corresponds closely to the receptive field profile predicted from Fourier synthesis of the cell's spatial frequency tuning curve. These profiles may thus reveal the spatial characteristics of subunits within complex cell-receptive fields. We examined the nature of the interaction between these subunits by performing several two-line interaction experiments in which the onset of the second bar was delayed some time after the onset of the first. The results suggest that neighbouring subunits interact in a facilitatory fashion: for an interval after the presentation of one bar, responses to neighbouring bars are enhanced. 5. The subunits of a complex receptive field may, by their spatial properties, determine the spatial selectivities of complex cells, while the nature of the interaction among the subunits may determine these cells' sensitivity and selectivity for moving visual stimuli...},

	Abstract = {Sensory neurons appear to adapt their gain to match the variance of signals along the dimension they encode, a property we shall call "contrast normalization". Contrast normalization has been the subject of extensive physiological and theoretical study. We previously found that neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) exhibit contrast normalization in their responses to full-field flickering white-noise stimuli, and that neurons with the strongest contrast normalization best preserved information transmission across a range of contrasts. We have also shown that both of these properties could be reproduced by non-adapting model cells. Here we present a detailed comparison of this non-adapting model to physiological data from the LGN. First, the model cells recapitulated other contrast dependencies of LGN responses: decreasing stimulus contrast resulted in an increase in spike-timing jitter and spike-number variability. Second, we find that the extent of contrast normalization in this model depends on model parameters related to refractoriness and to noise. Third, we show that the model cells exhibit rapid, transient changes in firing rate just after changes in contrast, and that this is sufficient to produce the transient changes in information transmission that have been reported in other neurons. It is known that intrinsic properties of neurons change upon contrast adaptation. Nevertheless the model demonstrates that the spiking nonlinearity of neurons can produce many of the temporal aspects of contrast gain control, including normalization to input variance and transient effects of contrast change.},

	Abstract = {Rhesus monkeys are widely used as animal models of human attention. Such research rests upon the assumption that similar mechanisms underlie attention in both species. Here, we directly compare the influence of low-level stimulus features on overt attention in monkeys and humans under natural conditions. We recorded eye-movements in humans and rhesus monkeys during free-viewing of natural images. We find that intrinsic low-level features, such luminance-contrast, texture-contrast and saliency-as predicted by a standard model, are elevated at fixation points in the majority of images. These correlative effects are not significantly different between species. However, local image modifications affect both species differently: moderate modifications, which are in the range of natural fluctuations, attract overt attention in monkeys significantly stronger than they do in humans. In addition, humans show a higher inter-individual consistency regarding which locations they fixate than monkeys, in spite of the similarity for intrinsic low-level features. Taken together, these data demonstrate that-under natural conditions-low-level stimulus features affect attention in monkeys and humans differently.},

	Abstract = {Nearly 40 years ago, in the pages of this journal, Hubel and Wiesel provided the first description of receptive fields in the primary visual cortex of higher mammals. They defined two classes of cortical cells, "simple" and "complex", based on neural responses to simple visual stimuli. The notion of a hierarchy of receptive fields, where increasingly intricate receptive fields are constructed from more elementary ones, was introduced. Since those early days we have witnessed the birth of quantitative methods to map receptive fields and mathematical descriptions of simple and complex cell function. Insights gained from these models, along with new theoretical concepts, are refining our understanding of receptive field structure and the underlying cortical circuitry. Here, I provide a brief historical account of the evolution of receptive field mapping in visual cortex along with the associated conceptual advancements, and speculate on the shape novel theories of the cortex may take as a result these measurements.},

	Abstract = {The visual system integrates information from the left and right eyes and constructs a visual world that is perceived as single and three dimensional. To understand neural mechanisms underlying this process, it is important to learn about how signals from the two eyes interact at the level of single neurons. Using a sophisticated receptive field (RF) mapping technique that employs binary m-sequences, we have determined the rules of binocular interactions exhibited by simple cells in the cat's striate cortex in relation to the structure of their monocular RFs. We find that binocular interaction RFs of most simple cells are well described as the product of left and right eye RFs. Therefore the binocular interactions depend not only on binocular disparity but also on monocular stimulus position or phase. The binocular interaction RF is consistent with that predicted by a model of a linear binocular filter followed by a static nonlinearity. The static nonlinearity is shown to have a shape of a half-power function with an average exponent of approximately 2. Although the initial binocular convergence of signals is linear, the static nonlinearity makes binocular interaction multiplicative at the output of simple cells. This multiplicative binocular interaction is a key ingredient for the computation of interocular cross-correlation, an algorithm for solving the stereo correspondence problem. Therefore simple cells may perform initial computations necessary to solve this problem.},

	Abstract = {Early stages of visual processing may exploit the characteristic structure of natural visual stimuli. This structure may differ from the intrinsic structure of natural scenes, because sampling of the environment is an active process. For example, humans move their eyes several times a second when looking at a scene. The portions of a scene that fall on the fovea are sampled at high spatial resolution, and receive a disproportionate fraction of cortical processing. We recorded the eye positions of human subjects while they viewed images of natural scenes. We report that active selection affected the statistics of the stimuli encountered by the fovea, and also by the parafovea up to eccentricities of 4 degrees. We found two related effects. First, subjects looked at image regions that had high spatial contrast. Second, in these regions, the intensities of nearby image points (pixels) were less correlated with each other than in images selected at random. These effects could serve to increase the information available to the visual system for further processing. We show that both of these effects can be simply obtained by constructing an artificial ensemble comprised of the highest-contrast regions of images.},

	Abstract = {The classical receptive fields of simple cells in the visual cortex have been shown to emerge from the statistical properties of natural images by forcing the cell responses to be maximally sparse, i.e. significantly activated only rarely. Here, we show that this single principle of sparseness can also lead to emergence of topography (columnar organization) and complex cell properties as well. These are obtained by maximizing the sparsenesses of locally pooled energies, which correspond to complex cell outputs. Thus, we obtain a highly parsimonious model of how these properties of the visual cortex are adapted to the characteristics of the natural input.},

	Abstract = {Understanding how the spectacular diversity of colour patterns on butterfly wings is shaped by natural selection, and how particular pattern elements are generated, has been the focus of both evolutionary and developmental biologists. The growing field of evolutionary developmental biology has now begun to provide a link between genetic variation and the phenotypes that are produced by developmental processes and that are sorted by natural selection. Butterfly wing patterns are set to become one of the few examples of morphological diversity to be studied successfully at many levels of biological organization, and thus to yield a more complete picture of adaptive morphological evolution.},

	Abstract = {We investigated the spatial organization of surround suppression in primate primary visual cortex (V1). We utilized drifting stimuli, configured to extend either from within the classical receptive field (CRF) to surrounding visual space, or from surrounding visual space into the CRF or subdivided to generate direction contrast, to make a detailed examination of the strength, spatial organization, direction dependence, mechanisms, and laminar distribution of surround suppression. Most cells (99/105, 94%) through all cortical layers, exhibited suppression (mean reduction 67%) to uniform stimuli exceeding the CRF, and 43% exhibited a more than 70% reduction. Testing with an annulus revealed two different patterns of surround influence. Some cells (37% of cells), classical surround suppression (CSS) cells exhibited responses to an annulus encroaching on the CRF that were less than the plateau in the spatial summation curve. The majority (63%), center-gated surround suppression (CGSS) cells, showed responses to annuli that equaled or exceeded the plateau in the spatial summation curve. Analysis suggested the CSS mechanism was implemented in all cells while the CGSS mechanism was implemented in varying strength across the sample with the extreme reflected in cells that gave larger responses to annuli than to a center stimulus. Reversing the direction of motion of the portion of the stimulus surrounding the CRF revealed four different patterns of effect: no reduction in the degree of suppression (22% of cells), a reduction in surround suppression (41%), a facilitation of the response above the level to the inner stimulus alone (37%), and a facilitation of the response above that to the inner stimulus alone that also exceeded the values associated with an optimal inner stimulus. The facilitatory effects were only seen for reverse direction interfaces between the central and surrounding stimulus at diameters equal to or more than the CRF size. The zones driving the suppressive influences and the direction contrast facilitation were often spatially heterogeneous and for a number of cells bore strong comparison with the class of behavior reported for surround mechanisms in MT. This suggests a potential role, for example, in extracting information about motion contrast in the representation of the three dimensional structure of moving objects.},

@article{frazor2004a,
	Abstract = {We measured the responses of striate cortex neurons as a function of spatial frequency on a fine time scale, over the course of an interval that is comparable to the duration of a single fixation (200 ms). Stationary gratings were flashed on for 200 ms and then off for 300 ms; the responses were analyzed at sequential 1-ms intervals. We found that 1) the preferred spatial frequency shifts through time from low frequencies to high frequencies, 2) the latency of the response increases as a function of spatial frequency, and 3) the poststimulus time histograms (PSTHs) are relatively shape-invariant across spatial frequency. The dynamic shifts in preferred spatial frequency appear to be a simple consequence of the latency shifts and the transient nature of the PSTH. The effects of these dynamic shifts on the coding of spatial frequency information are examined within the context of several different temporal integration strategies, and pattern-detection performance is determined as a function of the interval of integration, following response onset. The findings are considered within the context of related investigations as well as a number of functional issues: motion selectivity in depth, "coarse-to-fine" processing, direction selectivity, latency as a code for stimulus attributes, and behavioral response latency. Finally, we demonstrate that the results are qualitatively consistent with a simple feedforward model, similar to the one originally proposed in 1962 by Hubel and Wiesel, that incorporates measured differences in the response latencies and the receptive field sizes of different lateral geniculate nucleus inputs.},

@article{epstein1998a,
	Abstract = {Medial temporal brain regions such as the hippocampal formation and parahippocampal cortex have been generally implicated in navigation and visual memory. However, the specific function of each of these regions is not yet clear. Here we present evidence that a particular area within human parahippocampal cortex is involved in a critical component of navigation: perceiving the local visual environment. This region, which we name the 'parahippocampal place area' (PPA), responds selectively and automatically in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to passively viewed scenes, but only weakly to single objects and not at all to faces. The critical factor for this activation appears to be the presence in the stimulus of information about the layout of local space. The response in the PPA to scenes with spatial layout but no discrete objects (empty rooms) is as strong as the response to complex meaningful scenes containing multiple objects (the same rooms furnished) and over twice as strong as the response to arrays of multiple objects without three-dimensional spatial context (the furniture from these rooms on a blank background). This response is reduced if the surfaces in the scene are rearranged so that they no longer define a coherent space. We propose that the PPA represents places by encoding the geometry of the local environment.},

	Abstract = {We examined the activity of neurons in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) during a task in which we measured attention in the monkey, using an advantage in contrast sensitivity as our definition of attention. The animals planned a memory-guided saccade but made or canceled it depending on the orientation of a briefly flashed probe stimulus. We measured the monkeys' contrast sensitivity by varying the contrast of the probe. Both subjects had better thresholds at the goal of the saccade than elsewhere. If a task-irrelevant distractor flashed elsewhere in the visual field, the attentional advantage transiently shifted to that site. The population response in LIP correlated with the allocation of attention; the attentional advantage lay at the location in the visual field whose representation in LIP had the greatest activity when the probe appeared. During a brief period in which there were two equally active regions in LIP, there was no attentional advantage at either location. This time, the crossing point, differed in the two animals, proving a strong correlation between the activity and behavior. The crossing point of each neuron depended on the relationship of three parameters: the visual response to the distractor, the saccade-related delay activity, and the rate of decay of the transient response to the distractor. Thus the time at which attention lingers on a distractor is set by the mechanism underlying these three biophysical properties. Finally, we showed that for a brief time LIP neurons showed a stronger response to signal canceling the planned saccade than to the confirmation signal.},

	Abstract = {Persistent drug-seeking behavior is hypothesized to co-opt the brain's natural reward-motivational system. Although ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) neurons represent a crucial component of this system, the synaptic adaptations underlying natural rewards and drug-related motivation have not been fully elucidated. Here, we show that self-administration of cocaine, but not passive cocaine infusions, produced a persistent potentiation of VTA excitatory synapses, which was still present after 3 months abstinence. Further, enhanced synaptic function in VTA was evident even after 3 weeks of extinction training. Food or sucrose self-administration induced only a transient potentiation of VTA glutamatergic signaling. Our data show that synaptic function in VTA DA neurons is readily but reversibly enhanced by natural reward-seeking behavior, while voluntary cocaine self-administration induced a persistent synaptic enhancement that is resistant to behavioral extinction. Such persistent synaptic potentiation in VTA DA neurons may represent a fundamental cellular phenomenon driving pathological drug-seeking behavior.},

	Abstract = {Olfactory signals are transduced by a large family of odorant receptor proteins, each of which corresponds to a unique glomerulus in the first olfactory relay of the brain. Crosstalk between glomeruli has been proposed to be important in olfactory processing, but it is not clear how these interactions shape the odour responses of second-order neurons. In the Drosophila antennal lobe (a region analogous to the vertebrate olfactory bulb), we selectively removed most interglomerular input to genetically identified second-order olfactory neurons. Here we show that this broadens the odour tuning of these neurons, implying that interglomerular inhibition dominates over interglomerular excitation. The strength of this inhibitory signal scales with total feedforward input to the entire antennal lobe, and has similar tuning in different glomeruli. A substantial portion of this interglomerular inhibition acts at a presynaptic locus, and our results imply that this is mediated by both ionotropic and metabotropic receptors on the same nerve terminal.},

	Abstract = {Layer 2/3 (L2/3) pyramidal neurons are the most abundant cells of the neocortex. Despite their key position in the cortical microcircuit, synaptic integration in dendrites of L2/3 neurons is far less understood than in L5 pyramidal cell dendrites, mainly because of the difficulties in obtaining electrical recordings from thin dendrites. Here we directly measured passive and active properties of the apical dendrites of L2/3 neurons in rat brain slices using dual dendritic-somatic patch-clamp recordings and calcium imaging. Unlike L5 cells, L2/3 dendrites displayed little sag in response to long current pulses, which suggests a low density of I(h) in the dendrites and soma. This was also consistent with a slight increase in input resistance with distance from the soma. Brief current injections into the apical dendrite evoked relatively short (half-width 2-4 ms) dendritic spikes that were isolated from the soma for near-threshold currents at sites beyond the middle of the apical dendrite. Regenerative dendritic potentials and large concomitant calcium transients were also elicited by trains of somatic action potentials (APs) above a critical frequency (130 Hz), which was slightly higher than in L5 neurons. Initiation of dendritic spikes was facilitated by backpropagating somatic APs and could cause an additional AP at the soma. As in L5 neurons, we found that distal dendritic calcium transients are sensitive to a long-lasting block by GABAergic inhibition. We conclude that L2/3 pyramidal neurons can generate dendritic spikes, sharing with L5 pyramidal neurons fundamental properties of dendritic excitability and control by inhibition.},

	Abstract = {The essential trace mineral, selenium, is of fundamental importance to human health. As a constituent of selenoproteins, selenium has structural and enzymic roles, in the latter context being best-known as an antioxidant and catalyst for the production of active thyroid hormone. Selenium is needed for the proper functioning of the immune system, and appears to be a key nutrient in counteracting the development of virulence and inhibiting HIV progression to AIDS. It is required for sperm motility and may reduce the risk of miscarriage. Deficiency has been linked to adverse mood states. Findings have been equivocal in linking selenium to cardiovascular disease risk although other conditions involving oxidative stress and inflammation have shown benefits of a higher selenium status. An elevated selenium intake may be associated with reduced cancer risk. Large clinical trials are now planned to confirm or refute this hypothesis. In the context of these health effects, low or diminishing selenium status in some parts of the world, notably in some European countries, is giving cause for concern.},

	Abstract = {The responsivity of primary sensory cortical neurons is reduced following prolonged adaptation, but such adaptation has been little studied in higher sensory areas. Adaptation to visual motion has strong perceptual effects, so we studied the effect of prolonged stimulation on neuronal responsivity in the macaque's area MT, a cortical area whose importance to visual motion perception is well established. We adapted MT neurons with sinusoidal gratings drifting in the preferred or null direction. Preferred adaptation reduced the responsiveness of MT cells, primarily by changing their contrast gain, and this effect was spatially specific within the receptive field. Null adaptation reduced the ability of null gratings to inhibit the response to a simultaneously presented preferred stimulus. While both preferred and null adaptation alter MT responses, these effects probably do not occur in MT neurons but are likely to reflect adaptation-induced changes in contrast gain earlier in the visual pathway.},

	Abstract = {One of the major lessons of memory research has been that human memory is fallible, imprecise, and subject to interference. Thus, although observers can remember thousands of images, it is widely assumed that these memories lack detail. Contrary to this assumption, here we show that long-term memory is capable of storing a massive number of objects with details from the image. Participants viewed pictures of 2,500 objects over the course of 5.5 h. Afterward, they were shown pairs of images and indicated which of the two they had seen. The previously viewed item could be paired with either an object from a novel category, an object of the same basic-level category, or the same object in a different state or pose. Performance in each of these conditions was remarkably high (92%, 88%, and 87%, respectively), suggesting that participants successfully maintained detailed representations of thousands of images. These results have implications for cognitive models, in which capacity limitations impose a primary computational constraint (e.g., models of object recognition), and pose a challenge to neural models of memory storage and retrieval, which must be able to account for such a large and detailed storage capacity.},

	Abstract = {Motor control requires the generation of a precise temporal sequence of control signals sent to the skeletal musculature. We describe an experiment that, for good performance, requires human subjects to plan movements taking into account uncertainty in their movement duration and the increase in that uncertainty with increasing movement duration. We do this by rewarding movements performed within a specified time window, and penalizing slower movements in some conditions and faster movements in others. Our results indicate that subjects compensated for their natural duration-dependent temporal uncertainty as well as an overall increase in temporal uncertainty that was imposed experimentally. Their compensation for temporal uncertainty, both the natural duration-dependent and imposed overall components, was nearly optimal in the sense of maximizing expected gain in the task. The motor system is able to model its temporal uncertainty and compensate for that uncertainty so as to optimize the consequences of movement.},

	Abstract = {The effects of treatment modality for Graves' disease (GD) were studied with respect to long-term quality of life and present health status. A total of 179 patients with GD were randomized during the period 1983-1990 for treatment with antithyroid drugs, radioiodine, or surgery. A 36-item Short Form Health Status Survey questionnaire and specific questions for GD were sent to patients 14-21 years after randomization. Present medical records, and clinical and laboratory status were recorded. No major significant differences in quality of life among the three treatments were observed. Compared to a large Swedish reference group, all treatment groups had significantly lower scores for vitality (p \textless 0.05). The Mental Component Summary was lower for both the young medical, young surgical, and the older medical group (p \textless 0.05). Radioiodine-treated patients had a lower General Health score. Young medical patients (\textless35 years) had lower Mental Health scores (p \textless 0.05). There was also a strong trend, which barely met statistically significance, for older surgical and radioiodine groups for lower Mental Component Summary. GD patients have, compared with a large Swedish reference population, diminished vital and mental quality of life aspects even many years after treatment. The quality-of-life scores were not different among the three treatment modalities.},

	Abstract = {Comparative studies suggest that at least some bird species have evolved mental skills similar to those found in humans and apes. This is indicated by feats such as tool use, episodic-like memory, and the ability to use one's own experience in predicting the behavior of conspecifics. It is, however, not yet clear whether these skills are accompanied by an understanding of the self. In apes, self-directed behavior in response to a mirror has been taken as evidence of self-recognition. We investigated mirror-induced behavior in the magpie, a songbird species from the crow family. As in apes, some individuals behaved in front of the mirror as if they were testing behavioral contingencies. When provided with a mark, magpies showed spontaneous mark-directed behavior. Our findings provide the first evidence of mirror self-recognition in a non-mammalian species. They suggest that essential components of human self-recognition have evolved independently in different vertebrate classes with a separate evolutionary history.},

	Abstract = {Although temporal coding is a frequent topic of neurophysiology research, trial-to-trial variability in temporal codes is typically dismissed as noise and thought to play no role in sensory function. Here, we show that much of this supposed "noise" faithfully reflects stimulus-related processes carried out in coherent neural networks. Cortical neurons responded to sensory stimuli by progressing through sequences of states, identifiable only in examinations of simultaneously recorded ensembles. The specific times at which ensembles transitioned from state to state varied from trial to trial, but the state sequences were reliable and stimulus-specific. Thus, the characterization of ensemble responses in terms of state sequences captured facets of sensory processing that are missing from, and obscured in, other analyses. This work provides evidence that sensory neurons act as parts of a systems-level dynamic process, the nature of which can best be appreciated through observation of distributed ensembles.},

However, previous investigators implicitly or explicitly considered the extent of cortical spatial summation and, therefore, the size of the classical receptive field to be fixed and independent of stimulus characteristics or of surrounding context. On the contrary, we found that the extent of spatial summation in macaque V1 neurons depended on contrast, and was on average 2.3-fold greater at low contrast. This adaptive increase in spatial summation at low contrast was seen in cells throughout V1 and was independent of surround inhibition.},

@article{lehky2005a,
	Abstract = {Probability distributions of macaque complex cell responses to a large set of images were determined. Measures of selectivity were based on the overall shape of the response probability distribution, as quantified by either kurtosis or entropy. We call this non-parametric selectivity, in contrast to parametric selectivity, which measures tuning curve bandwidths. To examine how receptive field properties affected non-parametric selectivity, two models of complex cells were created. One was a standard Gabor energy model, and the other a slight variant constructed from a Gabor function and its Hilbert transform. Functionally, these models differed primarily in the size of their DC responses. The Hilbert model produced higher selectivities than the Gabor model, with the two models bracketing the data from above and below. Thus we see that tiny changes in the receptive field profiles can lead to major changes in selectivity. While selectivity looks at the response distribution of a single neuron across a set of stimuli, sparseness looks at the response distribution of a population of neurons to a single stimulus. In the model, we found that on average the sparseness of a population was equal to the selectivity of cells comprising that population, a property we call ergodicity. We raise the possibility that high sparseness is the result of distortions in the shape of response distributions caused by non-linear, information-losing transforms, unrelated to information theoretic issues of efficient coding.},

	Abstract = {The eye-tracking method was used to assess attentional orienting to and engagement on emotional visual scenes. In Experiment 1, unpleasant, neutral, or pleasant target pictures were presented simultaneously with neutral control pictures in peripheral vision under instruction to compare pleasantness of the pictures. The probability of first fixating an emotional picture, and the frequency of subsequent fixations, were greater than those for neutral pictures. In Experiment 2, participants were instructed to avoid looking at the emotional pictures, but these were still more likely to be fixated first and gazed longer during the first-pass viewing than neutral pictures. Low-level visual features cannot explain the results. It is concluded that overt visual attention is captured by both unpleasant and pleasant emotional content.},

	Abstract = { Thalamic relay cells fire action potentials that transmit information from retina to cortex. The amount of information that spike trains encode is usually estimated from the precision of spike timing with respect to the stimulus. Sensory input, however, is only one factor that influences neural activity. For example, intrinsic dynamics, such as oscillations of networks of neurons, also modulate firing pattern. Here, we asked if retinal oscillations might help to convey information to neurons downstream. Specifically, we made whole-cell recordings from relay cells to reveal retinal inputs (EPSPs) and thalamic outputs (spikes) and analyzed these events with information theory. Our results show that thalamic spike trains operate as two multiplexed channels. One channel, which occupies a low frequency band (<30 Hz), is encoded by average firing rate with respect to the stimulus and carries information about local changes in the image over time. The other operates in the gamma frequency band (40-80 Hz) and is encoded by spike time relative to the retinal oscillations. Because these oscillations involve extensive areas of the retina, it is likely that the second channel transmits information about global features of the visual scene. At times, the second channel conveyed even more information than the first. },

	Abstract = {How does scene context guide search behavior to likely target locations? We had observers search for scene-constrained and scene-unconstrained targets, and found that scene-constrained targets were detected faster and with fewer eye movements. Observers also directed more initial saccades to target-consistent scene regions and devoted more time to searching these regions. However, final checking fixations on target-inconsistent regions were common in target-absent trials, suggesting that scene context does not strictly confine search to likely target locations. We interpret these data as evidence for a rapid top-down biasing of search behavior by scene context to the target-consistent regions of a scene.},

	Abstract = {Lateral interactions between spatial filters were explored with a lateral masking paradigm. Contrast sensitivity (two-alternative forced-choice) for a Gabor signal in the presence of two flanking high contrast Gabor signals (masks) was measured. When the target to mask distance was less than 2 target wavelengths the contrast sensitivity decreased up to a factor of two relative to a no mask condition. At larger separations, up to eight wavelengths, an increase in contrast sensitivity occurred. This increase was maximal at separation distances of 2-3 wavelengths, where sensitivity increased by a factor of two. However, the enhancement magnitude and range was dependent on the offset between the Gabor signal orientation and the direction defined by the virtual line connecting the two masks (global orientation). Maximal effects occurred when this offset was zero (100% increase in sensitivity) and 90 deg (50% increase). A 45 deg offset yielded only a small enhancement (20%). The enhancement dependence on spatial arrangement was found to be invariant across different global orientations (meridian). This pattern of interactions may be involved in grouping colinear line segments into smooth curves.},

	Abstract = {The design of a macroscope constructed with photography lenses is described and several applications are demonstrated. The macroscope incorporates epi-illumination, a 0.4 numerical aperture, and a 40 mm working distance for imaging wide fields in the range of 1.5-20 mm in diameter. At magnifications of 1X to 2.5X, fluorescence images acquired with the macroscope were 100-700 times brighter than those obtained with commercial microscope objectives at similar magnifications. In several biological applications, the improved light collection efficiency (20-fold, typical) not only minimized bleaching effects, but, in concert with improved illumination throughput (15-fold, typical), significantly enhanced object visibility as well. Reduced phototoxicity and increased signal-to-noise ratios were observed in the in vivo real-time optical imaging of cortical activity using voltage-sensitive dyes. Furthermore, the macroscope has a depth of field which is 5-10 times thinner than that of a conventional low-power microscope. This shallow depth of field has facilitated the imaging of cortical architecture based on activity-dependent intrinsic cortical signals in the living primate brain. In these reflection measurements large artifacts from the surface blood vessels, which were observed with conventional lenses, were eliminated with the macroscope.},

	Abstract = {We present a comprehensive analysis of the intrinsic variability of the periodicity of ocular dominance columns in cat primary visual cortex (area 17) and its relationship to genetic background and visual experience. We characterized the intra-areal and interindividual variability of column spacing in a large set (n = 49) of ocular dominance patterns adapting a recently developed technique for the two-dimensional analysis of orientation column patterns. Patterns were obtained from three different cat colonies (termed F, M and D), the cats having either normal visual experience or experimentally induced strabismus. Two-dimensional maps of local column spacing were calculated for every pattern. In individual cortices, local column spacings varied by > 50% with the majority of column spacings ranging between 0.6 and 1.5 mm in different animals. In animals from colonies F and M (n = 29), the mean column spacing ranged between 1.03 and 1.27 mm and exhibited no significant differences, either between the two breeds or between strabismic and normal animals. The mean spacing was moderately clustered in the left and right brain hemisphere of individual animals but not in littermates. In animals from colony D (n = 2), average column spacing ranged between 0.73 and 0.95 mm, and was thus significantly different from the distribution of spacings in animals from breeds F and M, suggesting an influence of genetic factors on the layout of ocular dominance columns. Local column spacing exhibited a considerable systematic intra-areal variation, with largest spacings along the representation of the horizontal meridian and smallest spacings along the peripheral representation of the vertical meridian. The total variability of ocular dominance column spacing comprised 24% systematic intra-areal variation, 18% interindividual differences of mean column spacing and 58% nonsystematic intra-areal variability.},

	Abstract = {The early visual system is endowed with adaptive mechanisms that rapidly adjust gain and integration time based on the local luminance (mean intensity) and contrast (standard deviation of intensity relative to the mean). Here we show that these mechanisms are matched to the statistics of the environment. First, we measured the joint distribution of luminance and contrast in patches selected from natural images and found that luminance and contrast were statistically independent of each other. This independence did not hold for artificial images with matched spectral characteristics. Second, we characterized the effects of the adaptive mechanisms in lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), the direct recipient of retinal outputs. We found that luminance gain control had the same effect at all contrasts and that contrast gain control had the same effect at all mean luminances. Thus, the adaptive mechanisms for luminance and contrast operate independently, reflecting the very independence encountered in natural images.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Antithyroidal drugs (ATD) are used in the management of Graves' disease either as primary therapy for several months while awaiting remission of the disease or as pretreatment for several weeks prior to definitive radioactive iodine therapy (RAI). We have reported previously that pretreatment with propylthiouracil (PTU) before definitive RAI therapy is associated with a higher RAI treatment failure rate than RAI therapy alone. The objectives of the current study were 2-fold. First, to verify the results of our prior study regarding the effect of PTU used as pretreatment before RAI in a cohort of patients from a different institution and, secondly, to better define the relationship between the number of days off PTU before RAI therapy and therapeutic efficacy of RAI dosing. DESIGN: A retrospective review of Graves' disease patients treated from 1980 to 1994. PATIENTS: Study patients had to meet the following inclusion criteria: radionuclide studies and thyroid hormone values consistent with Graves' disease, at least 1 year of follow-up data available and discontinuation of the ATD at least 4 days before RAI administration. Exclusion criteria included therapy with any ATD other than PTU or ATD therapy during or following RAI dosing. MEASUREMENTS: Effectiveness of RAI therapy, days on PTU, days off PTU and calculated RAI dose to the thyroid were recorded for each subject. We compared the efficacy of RAI therapy in patients treated with PTU (used either as pretreatment in preparation for RAI therapy or as primary long-term therapy) before RAI administrations to those treated with RAI alone with special attention to the number of days on and off PTU before RAI dosing. Patients were considered RAI treatment failures if a second dose of RAI was required to achieve a euthyroid or hypothyroid state. RESULTS: One hundred and sixteen patients met our study criteria. Forty patients received PTU therapy for a mean of 221 +/- 59 days. The PTU was discontinued for a mean of 60 +/- 25 days before RAI dosing. Persistent hyperthyroidism was seen in 9% (7/76) of patients treated with RAI alone. The failure rate of a single dose of radioactive iodine was significantly increased when PTU was discontinued between 4 and 7 days before the administration of RAI (29% vs 9% for RAI alone, P = 0.039). PTU discontinued for at least 1 week before RAI dosing was associated with a nearly 2-fold increase in failure rate, but this difference did not achieve significance (17% vs 9% for RAI alone, P = 0.24). Examining only those patients receiving PTU, patients who had successful single dose RAI therapy tended to receive a higher dose of RAI than patients failing RAI therapy (480 +/- 30 vs 410 +/- 40 MBq administered dose, P = 0.18; and 8.0 +/- 0.9 vs 5.5 +/- 1.1 MBq/g thyroid tissue calculated dose, P = 0.21). Furthermore, total serum thyroxine at diagnosis was significantly higher in patients failing RAI therapy after PTU administration than in patients successfully treated with RAI after receiving PTU (316 +/- 40 vs 225 +/- 13 nmol/L, P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Propylthiouracil discontinued 4-7 days before radioiodine dosing is associated with a significant increase in the failure rate of a single dose of radioiodine. Discontinuation of the propylthiouracil for at least a week before radioiodine administration is associated with a higher, although not statistically significant, radioiodine failure rate. In patients that require treatment with propylthiouracil before radioiodine therapy, a higher total serum thyroxine level at diagnosis is associated with an increased rate of radioiodine failure. Consideration should be given to increasing empirically the dose of radioiodine administered to Graves' disease patients that have received propylthiouracil within a week of radioiodine administration in an effort to decrease the radioiodine failure rate to an acceptable level.},

	Abstract = {To provide information about dynamic sensory stimuli, the pattern of action potentials in spiking neurons must be variable. To ensure reliability these variations must be related, reproducibly, to the stimulus. For H1, a motion-sensitive neuron in the fly's visual system, constant-velocity motion produces irregular spike firing patterns, and spike counts typically have a variance comparable to the mean, for cells in the mammalian cortex. But more natural, time-dependent input signals yield patterns of spikes that are much more reproducible, both in terms of timing and of counting precision. Variability and reproducibility are quantified with ideas from information theory, and measured spike sequences in H1 carry more than twice the amount of information they would if they followed the variance-mean relation seen with constant inputs. Thus, models that may accurately account for the neural response to static stimuli can significantly underestimate the reliability of signal transfer under more natural conditions.},

However during more natural stimulation conditions, the neuron exhibit striking reliability in its trial to trial behavior. Additionally, they found that spikes convey an information of around 5 bits, and nearly 2 bits of it being noise related. When instead they use a simulated Poisson neuron with exactly the same firing rate as the recorded neuron, they observed that the reliability is much more high and consequently 4 bits of the conveyed information is noise related. "Real spike trains are almost as variable as possible given the mean spike rate, but they are much more reproducible than Poisson trains. H1 thus transmits more than twice as much information about these stimuli as would be the case if the neuron exhibited the noisiness found with constant inputs."},

	Abstract = {Contrast adaptation is a psychophysical phenomenon, the neuronal bases of which reside largely in the primary visual cortex. The cellular mechanisms of contrast adaptation were investigated in the cat primary visual cortex in vivo through intracellular recording and current injections. Visual cortex cells, and to a much less extent, dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) neurons, exhibited a reduction in firing rate during prolonged presentations of a high-contrast visual stimulus, a process we termed high-contrast adaptation. In a majority of cortical and dLGN cells, the period of adaptation to high contrast was followed by a prolonged (5-80 sec) period of reduced responsiveness to a low-contrast stimulus (postadaptation suppression), an effect that was associated, and positively correlated, with a hyperpolarization of the membrane potential and an increase in apparent membrane conductance. In simple cells, the period of postadaptation suppression was not consistently associated with a decrease in the grating modulated component of the evoked synaptic barrages (the F1 component). The generation of the hyperpolarization appears to be at least partially intrinsic to the recorded cells, because the induction of neuronal activity with the intracellular injection of current resulted in both a hyperpolarization of the membrane potential and a decrease in the spike response to either current injections or visual stimuli. Conversely, high-contrast visual stimulation could suppress the response to low-intensity sinusoidal current injection. We conclude that control of the membrane potential by intrinsic neuronal mechanisms contributes importantly to the adaptation of neuronal responsiveness to varying levels of contrast. This feedback mechanism, internal to cortical neurons, provides them with the ability to continually adjust their responsiveness as a function of their history of synaptic and action potential activity.},

The firing rate of a spontaneously active single neuron strongly depends on the instantaneous spatial pattern of ongoing population activity in a large cortical area. Very similar spatial patterns of population activity were observed both when the neuron fired spontaneously and when it was driven by its optimal stimulus. The evoked patterns could be used to reconstruct the spontaneous activity of single neurons.},

Contrary to Ricciardelli et al., for both distractor types, saccade latencies were slower, and participants made more directional errors, on incongruent than on congruent trials. Moreover, a cost-benefit analysis showed no difference between the two distractor types.

@article{sprekeler2007a,
	Abstract = {Our nervous system can efficiently recognize objects in spite of changes in contextual variables such as perspective or lighting conditions. Several lines of research have proposed that this ability for invariant recognition is learned by exploiting the fact that object identities typically vary more slowly in time than contextual variables or noise. Here, we study the question of how this "temporal stability" or "slowness" approach can be implemented within the limits of biologically realistic spike-based learning rules. We first show that slow feature analysis, an algorithm that is based on slowness, can be implemented in linear continuous model neurons by means of a modified Hebbian learning rule. This approach provides a link to the trace rule, which is another implementation of slowness learning. Then, we show analytically that for linear Poisson neurons, slowness learning can be implemented by spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) with a specific learning window. By studying the learning dynamics of STDP, we show that for functional interpretations of STDP, it is not the learning window alone that is relevant but rather the convolution of the learning window with the postsynaptic potential. We then derive STDP learning windows that implement slow feature analysis and the "trace rule." The resulting learning windows are compatible with physiological data both in shape and timescale. Moreover, our analysis shows that the learning window can be split into two functionally different components that are sensitive to reversible and irreversible aspects of the input statistics, respectively. The theory indicates that irreversible input statistics are not in favor of stable weight distributions but may generate oscillatory weight dynamics. Our analysis offers a novel interpretation for the functional role of STDP in physiological neurons.},

	Abstract = {Stimulus-evoked oscillatory synchronization of activity has been observed in many neural systems, including the cerebral cortex of mammals and the brain of insects. The possible functions of such rhythmic synchronization in neural coding, however, remain largely speculative. In the locust, odours evoke activity in dynamic (evolving) ensembles of transiently synchronized neurons. We report here that the active neurons composing these ensembles change in a stimulus-specific manner and with a high degree of reliability on a cycle-by-cycle basis during an odour response. Hence, information about an odour is contained not only in the neural assembly active at each oscillation cycle, but also in the precise temporal sequence in which these assemblies are updated during an odour response. Neural coding with oscillations thus allows combinatorial representations in time as well as in space.},

	Abstract = {Optical imaging studies of orientation and direction preference in visual cortex have typically used vector averaging to obtain angle and magnitude maps. This method has shown half-rotation orientation singularities (pinwheels) located within regions of low orientation vector magnitude. Direction preference is generally orthogonal to orientation preference, but often deviates from this, particularly in regions of low direction vector magnitude. Linear regions of rapid change in direction preference terminate in or near orientation singularities. The vector-averaging method is problematic however because it does not clearly disambiguate spatial variation in orientation tuning width from variation in height. It may also wrongly estimate preferred direction in regions where preference is weak. In this paper we analyze optical maps of cat visual cortex by fitting model tuning functions to the responses. This new method reveals features not previously evident. Orientation tuning height and width vary independently across the map: tuning height is always low near singularities, however regions of broad and narrow orientation tuning width can be found in regions of low tuning height, often alternating in a spoke-like fashion around singularities. Orientation and direction preference angles are always closely orthogonal. Reversals in direction preference form lines that originate precisely in orientation singularities.},

@article{bonin2006a,
	Abstract = {In the early visual system, a contrast gain control mechanism sets the gain of responses based on the locally prevalent contrast. The measure of contrast used by this adaptation mechanism is commonly assumed to be the standard deviation of light intensities relative to the mean (root-mean-square contrast). A number of alternatives, however, are possible. For example, the measure of contrast might depend on the absolute deviations relative to the mean, or on the prevalence of the darkest or lightest intensities. We investigated the statistical computation underlying this measure of contrast in the cat's lateral geniculate nucleus, which relays signals from retina to cortex. Borrowing a method from psychophysics, we recorded responses to white noise stimuli whose distribution of intensities was precisely varied. We varied the standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis of the distribution of intensities while keeping the mean luminance constant. We found that gain strongly depends on the standard deviation of the distribution. At constant standard deviation, moreover, gain is invariant to changes in skewness or kurtosis. These findings held for both ON and OFF cells, indicating that the measure of contrast is independent of the range of stimulus intensities signaled by the cells. These results confirm the long-held assumption that contrast gain control computes root-mean-square contrast. They also show that contrast gain control senses the full distribution of intensities and leaves unvaried the relative responses of the different cell types. The advantages to visual processing of this remarkably specific computation are not entirely known.},

Competition among neurons in this map gives rise to a single winning location that corresponds to the next attended target. Inhibiting this location automatically allows the system to attend to the next most salient location. We describe a detailed computer implementation of such a scheme, focusing on the problem of combining information across modalities, here orientation, intensity and color information, in a purely stimulus-driven manner. The model is applied to common psychophysical stimuli as well as to a very demanding visual search task. Its successful performance is used to address the extent to which the primate visual system carries out visual search via one or more such saliency maps and how this can be tested.},

However, recent data on alpha-amplitude and, in particular, alpha-phase dynamics posit a direct and active role for alpha-frequency band rhythmicity in the mechanisms of attention and consciousness. We propose that simultaneous alpha-, beta- (14-30 Hz) and gamma- (30-70 Hz) frequency band oscillations are required for unified cognitive operations, and hypothesize that cross-frequency phase synchrony between alpha, beta and gamma oscillations coordinates the selection and maintenance of neuronal object representations during working memory, perception and consciousness.},

	Abstract = {Many learning rules for neural networks derive from abstract objective functions. The weights in those networks are typically optimized utilizing gradient ascent on the objective function. In those networks each neuron needs to store two variables. One variable, called activity, contains the bottom-up sensory-fugal information involved in the core signal processing. The other variable typically describes the derivative of the objective function with respect to the cell's activity and is exclusively used for learning. This variable allows the objective function's derivative to be calculated with respect to each weight and thus the weight update. Although this approach is widely used, the mapping of such two variables onto physiology is unclear, and these learning algorithms are often considered biologically unrealistic. However, recent research on the properties of cortical pyramidal neurons shows that these cells have at least two sites of synaptic integration, the basal and the apical dendrite, and are thus appropriately described by at least two variables. Here we discuss whether these results could constitute a physiological basis for the described abstract learning rules. As examples we demonstrate an implementation of the backpropagation of error algorithm and a specific self-supervised learning algorithm using these principles. Thus, compared to standard, one-integration-site neurons, it is possible to incorporate interesting properties in neural networks that are inspired by physiology with a modest increase of complexity.},

	Abstract = {To test theories of orientation selectivity in primary visual cortex (V1), we have done experiments to measure the dynamics of orientation tuning of single neurons in the V1 cortex of macaque monkeys. Based on our dynamics results, we propose that a V1 cell's orientation selectivity is generated mainly by both tuned enhancement and global suppression. Enhancement near the preferred orientation is probably caused by feed-forward input from LGN (plus amplification by cortical-cortical interaction). Global suppression could be supplied by cortical inhibition. Additionally, in about 1/3 of V1 neurons (usually the most sharply tuned) there is tuned suppression, centered near the cell's preferred orientation but broader than tuned enhancement. These mechanisms also can explain important features of steady-state selectivity in the V1 neuron population. Furthermore, similar neuronal mechanisms may be used generally throughout the cerebral cortex.},

	Abstract = {Interaural time differences (ITDs) are important cues for mammalian sound localization. At high frequencies, sensitivity to ITDs, which are conveyed only by the envelope of the waveforms, has been shown to be poorer than sensitivity to ITDs at low frequencies, which are conveyed primarily by the fine structure of the waveforms. Recently, human psychophysical experiments have demonstrated that sensitivity to envelope-based ITDs in high-frequency transposed tones can be equivalent to low-frequency fine-structure-based ITD sensitivity. Transposed tones are designed to provide high-frequency auditory nerve fibers (ANFs) with similar temporal information to that provided by low-frequency tones. We investigated neural sensitivity to ITDs in high-frequency transposed and sinusoidally amplitude modulated (SAM) tones, in the inferior colliculus of the guinea pig. Neural sensitivity to ITDs in transposed tones was found to be greater than that to ITDs in SAM tones; in response to transposed tones, neural firing rates were more modulated as a function of ITD and discrimination thresholds were found to be lower than those in response to SAM tones. Similar to psychophysical findings, ITD discrimination of single neurons in response to transposed tones for rates of modulation <250 Hz was comparable to neural discrimination of ITDs in low-frequency tones. This suggests that the neural mechanisms that mediate sensitivity to ITDs at high and low frequencies are functionally equivalent, provided that the stimuli result in appropriate temporal patterns of action potentials in ANFs.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Several factors may interfere with the success rate of radioiodine therapy (RIT) in Graves' disease. Our aim was to evaluate, retrospectively, some of these factors in the outcome of RIT. METHODS: Patient gender, age at diagnosis, ophthalmopathy, disease duration, thyroid size, drug used as clinical treatment, thionamide withdrawal period during RIT preparation, FT4, TSH and [99mTc]pertechnetate thyroid uptake prior to RIT were studied as potential interference factors for RIT success. Eighty-two Graves' disease patients were submitted to RIT after thionamide treatment failure. Prior to RIT, 67 patients were receiving methimazole and 15 propylthiouracil. Thirty-three patients received thionamides during RIT; in 49 patients the medication was withdrawn for 2-30 days. [99mTc]pertechnetate thyroid uptake was determined before RIT. Fixed doses of 370 MBq of [131I]iodide were administered to all patients. RESULTS: Eleven patients became euthyroid; 40 became hypothyroid and 31 remained hyperthyroid. There was no association between outcome and age at diagnosis, gender, ophthalmopathy, pre-RIT FT4, TSH, antithyroid antibodies or thyrostatic drug. Multiple logistic regression showed higher probability of treatment success in patients with thyroid mass <53 g (odds ratio (OR)=8.9), with pre-RIT thyroid uptake <12.5% (OR=4.1) and in patients who withdrew thionamide before RIT (OR=4.9). CONCLUSIONS: Fixed doses of 370 MBq of radioiodine seem to be practical and effective for treating Graves' disease patients with [99mTc]pertechnetate uptake <12.5% and thyroid mass <53 g. This treatment is clearly not recommended for patients with large goitre. In contrast to what could be expected, patients with a high pre-RIT thyroid uptake presented a higher rate of RIT failure.},

	Abstract = {Current understanding of many neural circuits is limited by our ability to explore the vast number of potential interactions between different cells. We present a new approach that dramatically reduces the complexity of this problem. Large-scale multi-electrode recordings were used to measure electrical activity in nearly complete, regularly spaced mosaics of several hundred ON and OFF parasol retinal ganglion cells in macaque monkey retina. Parasol cells exhibited substantial pairwise correlations, as has been observed in other species, indicating functional connectivity. However, pairwise measurements alone are insufficient to determine the prevalence of multi-neuron firing patterns, which would be predicted from widely diverging common inputs and have been hypothesized to convey distinct visual messages to the brain. The number of possible multi-neuron firing patterns is far too large to study exhaustively, but this problem may be circumvented if two simple rules of connectivity can be established: (1) multi-cell firing patterns arise from multiple pairwise interactions, and (2) interactions are limited to adjacent cells in the mosaic. Using maximum entropy methods from statistical mechanics, we show that pairwise and adjacent interactions accurately accounted for the structure and prevalence of multi-neuron firing patterns, explaining approximately 98% of the departures from statistical independence in parasol cells and approximately 99% of the departures that were reproducible in repeated measurements. This approach provides a way to define limits on the complexity of network interactions and thus may be relevant for probing the function of many neural circuits.},

	Abstract = {Integration of information from multiple senses is fundamental to perception and cognition, but when and where this is accomplished in the brain is not well understood. This study examined the timing and topography of cortical auditory-visual interactions using high-density event-related potentials (ERPs) during a simple reaction-time (RT) task. Visual and auditory stimuli were presented alone and simultaneously. ERPs elicited by the auditory and visual stimuli when presented alone were summed ('sum' ERP) and compared to the ERP elicited when they were presented simultaneously ('simultaneous' ERP). Divergence between the 'simultaneous' and 'sum' ERP indicated auditory-visual (AV) neural response interactions. There was a surprisingly early right parieto-occipital AV interaction, consistent with the finding of an earlier study [J. Cogn. Neurosci. 11 (1999) 473]. The timing of onset of this effect (46 ms) was essentially simultaneous with the onset of visual cortical processing, as indexed by the onset of the visual C1 component, which is thought to represent the earliest cortical visual evoked potential. The coincident timing of the early AV interaction and C1 strongly suggests that AV interactions can affect early visual sensory processing. Additional AV interactions were found within the time course of sensory processing (up to 200 ms post stimulus onset). In total, this system of AV effects over the scalp was suggestive of both activity unique to multisensory processing, and the modulation of 'unisensory' activity. RTs to the stimuli when presented simultaneously were significantly faster than when they were presented alone. This RT facilitation could not be accounted for by probability summation, as evidenced by violation of the 'race' model, providing compelling evidence that auditory-visual neural interactions give rise to this RT effect.},

	Abstract = {The attentional modulation of sensory information processing in the visual system is the result of top-down influences, which can cause a multiplicative modulation of the firing rate of sensory neurons in extrastriate visual cortex, an effect reminiscent of the bottom-up effect of changes in stimulus contrast. This similarity could simply reflect the multiplicity of both effects. But, here we show that in direction-selective neurons in monkey visual cortical area MT, stimulus and attentional effects share a nonlinearity. These neurons show higher response gain for both contrast and attentional changes for intermediate contrast stimuli and smaller gain for low- and high-contrast stimuli. This finding suggests a close relationship between the neural encoding of stimulus contrast and the modulating effect of the behavioral relevance of stimuli.},

	Abstract = {Attention modulates visual processing along at least two dimensions: a spatial dimension, which enhances the representation of stimuli within the focus of attention, and a feature dimension, which is thought to enhance attended visual features (e.g., upward motion) throughout the visual field. We investigate the consequences of feature-based attention onto visual perception, using dual-task human psychophysics and two distant drifting Gabor stimuli to systematically explore 64 combinations of visual features (orientations and drift speeds) and tasks (discriminating orientation or drift speed). The resulting single, consistent data set suggests a functional model, which predicts a maximum rule by which only the dominant product of feature enhancement and feature benefit by feature relevance may benefit perception.},

@article{nothdurft2002a,
	Abstract = {To investigate the role of salience in fast visual search, time courses for the detection and identification of salient targets were measured in six subjects, using texture-like line arrays. Single lines were made salient from luminance contrast, motion contrast, or by an added circular cue that is known to attract focal attention. Three major findings are reported: (1) Identification of target orientation required longer presentations than detection of the saliency effect itself, consistent with the model that target salience attracts focal attention for target analysis. (2) Different saliency mechanisms produced similar effects, suggesting that salience from feature contrast is functionally equivalent to salience evoked from a visual cue. (3) Circular cues were most effective when presented close to the target; performance in target identification decreased when the diameter was enlarged so that the cue was presented farther away and on a different spatial scale. All together, these findings suggest that popout targets in visual search may be detected fast and independent of set size because (a) they are salient and attract focal attention, and (b) their salience is produced on the same spatial scale and at the same location in the visual field where target properties are encoded.},

	Abstract = {Object descriptions are extracted and retained across saccades when observers view natural scenes. We investigated whether particular object properties are encoded and the stability of the resulting memories. We tested immediate recall of multiple types of information from real-world scenes and from computer-presented images of the same scenes. The relationship between fixations and properties of object memory was investigated. Position information was encoded and accumulated from multiple fixations. In contrast, identity and colour were encoded but did not require direct fixation and did not accumulate. In the current experiments, participants were unable to recall any information about shape or relative distances between objects. In addition, where information was encoded we found differential patterns of stability. Data from viewing real scenes and images were highly consistent, with stronger effects in the real-world conditions. Our findings imply that object files are not dependent upon the encoding of any particular object property and so are robust to dynamic visual environments.},

	Abstract = {Sleep is universal, strictly regulated, and necessary for cognition. Why this is so remains a mystery, although recent work suggests that sleep, memory, and plasticity are linked. However, little is known about how wakefulness and sleep affect synapses. Using Western blots and confocal microscopy in Drosophila, we found that protein levels of key components of central synapses were high after waking and low after sleep. These changes were related to behavioral state rather than time of day and occurred in all major areas of the Drosophila brain. The decrease of synaptic markers during sleep was progressive, and sleep was necessary for their decline. Thus, sleep may be involved in maintaining synaptic homeostasis altered by waking activities.},

	Abstract = {Perceptual learning refers to an improvement on a perceptual task after repeated exposure to a stimulus. It has been shown that attention can play an important role in perceptual learning. Recently, it has been suggested that training can lead to increased suppression of information that is continuously irrelevant, and that this attention-based suppression plays an important role in more efficient noise exclusion. Here we investigate this claim. Observers performed a visual speed-discrimination task for 5 consecutive days. After training, sensitivity to motion directions that were relevant, irrelevant, or neutral toward the training task was assessed by measuring motion coherence thresholds. In addition, perceptual dominance during binocular rivalry was assessed for combinations of the three motion directions. The results showed that sensitivity to the task-relevant feature increased due to training. That is, motion coherence thresholds were selectively lowered for the task-relevant feature. Interestingly, the feature that was task-irrelevant during training was more strongly suppressed during binocular rivalry: The mean perceptual dominance of this feature was selectively decreased. Our results show that task-irrelevant information that potentially interferes with the primary task during learning gets more strongly suppressed. Furthermore, our results add new evidence in support of the claim that mechanisms involved in visual attention and binocular rivalry overlap.},
