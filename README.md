# PhDThesis
If you like the layout of my thesis, you may find it useful to use the latex template that I used.
I share this with the idea that anyone who would like to start writing their theses, 
could easily use this template to start up producing, rather than wasting time to optimize the look of the final thesis. It might take considerable time until everything appears reasonably good.
