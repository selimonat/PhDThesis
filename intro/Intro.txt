The world let itself to living organisms to be experienced in multitude of
ways. This is the rational behind the wise sentence stating that the world
is infinitely complex. Indeed this claim is justified by the extraordinary
diversity of different members of the animal kingdom. Example... On a
background of an infinitely complex ecological tissue, members of animal
kingdom seems to be distributed, each being sensitive to different aspects
of the world we are all inhabiting. What is the origin of this diversity?
More precisely what determines a sensory system to be sensitive to a given
set of aspects of the environment and ignore to a good extent others? 


One answer, which is certainly the most popular one, would be that these
sensitivities result from the clockworks of evolution shaping different
sensory organs and epithelia to be adapted to different aspects of the
world, and not to the others by means of genetical and/or epigenetical
mechanisms. According to this view, sensory organs would have been evolved
toward their current state in order to process the input signals they are
sensitive to with higher reliability in such a way to increase the fitness
of the organism. Fly detector neurons found in the frog's visual
cortex serves as the milestone example illustrating this example. [How
different these fly neurons from center surround LGN responses]


This answer has certainly some truth in it. Adaptation as a tuning of
biological process has already been indeed shown to occur at various
organisms. [Examples] Yet conceiving adaptatif phenomena to be the sole explanatory
factor of the animal kingdom diversity and more specifically for sensory
adaptation occupies a debatable point.


The problem of this point of view is that it presupposes that the
environment is accessible to the organisms before the organisms are
sensitive to it. The problem summarizes into the popular chicken-egg
problem: which one came first; the sensory organ or the environment? Did
the sensory organ evolved within a given direction to process an attribute
of the external world which he had no access before hand? Let's illustrate
this view with an excellent passage of The Embodied Mind: 
 
 
 \begin{quote} 
 
 It is well known that honey bees are trichromats whose spectral
 sensitivity is shifted toward the ultraviolet. It is also well known that
 flowers have contrasting reflectance patterns in ultraviolet light.
 Consider now our "chicken-and-egg" question [...] :. Which came first, the
 world (ultraviolet reflectance) or the image (ultraviolet sensitive
 vision)?  Most of us would probably answer with little hesitation, The
 world (ultraviolet reflectance). It is therefore interesting to observe
 that the colors of flowers appear to have \textit{coevolved} with the
 ultraviolet sensitive, trichromatic vision of bees.

Why should such coevolution occur? One the one hand, flowers attract
pollinetors by their food content and so must be both conspicuous and yet
different from flowers of the other species. On the other hand, bees gather
food from flowers and so need to recognize flowers from distance. These two
broad and reciprocal constraints appear to have shaped a history of
coupling in which plant features and the sensorimotr capacities of bees
coevolved. It is this coupling, then, that is responsible  for both the
ultraviolet vision of bees and the ultraviolet reflectance patterns of
flowers. Such coevolution therefore provides an excellent exaxmple of how
environmental regularities are not pregiven but are rather enacted or
brought forth by a history of coupling."

 \end{quote}


This strong example emphasizes an important concept: structural
coupling. In this example, bees and flowers are two
components of a larger system. These two components by the virtue of their coupling
codetermine the fate of each other. In this paradigm, we needed not a
single time the idea of representation of external world by an agent. 

This view actually constitutes the orthodox neo-darwinist point of view.
However, I am not going to delve into details of the biological evolution as
this is not our main topic here. However biological evolution seems to be
an excellent tremplen to introduce to the very same problem we have in Cognitive
Sciences. Interestingly it translates one to one into Cognitive Sciences and there
also constitutes the major paradigm which is so widely accepted that it is
not easily possible to question its fondements.


Let's for a moment go back to the problem of the adaptationist
approach. It seemed to be a very plausible hypothesis to say that the
sensorial properties of an animal results from an adaptational process to
the external worlds properties.


Actually it is hard to dissociate this question of sensory diversity from
the animals' other attributes. The way that a given animal is designed, it
makes perfect sense that the animal is equipped with a given set of
sensory preferences. The obvious relationship of the body shape and the
potentials it generates and the sensory organs that an animal has, hints
that the problem of sensory diversity is not a simple problem which could be
explained by an adaptationist view. One should recognize the primacy of
animals being animated beings. As a fact of definition, animals are
animated things, the capacity of self motion being the unshared trait of
all animals. Importantly the nervous systems seem to be an invention of
animal kingdom, that is to say that the connection of sensation and action
is created via the nervous tissue. It may seem to be trivial to say this so
but there is no animal without a nervous system and thus it seems that the nervous systems are a necessary component
of beings able to self locomote.  

Strikingly, in our account on the last paragraph, this defining property of animals has not been used when we
tryied to explain the adaptation. We simply focused on the sensation and
created an explanatory framework within which we contented by an apparant
fit of sensory selectivities with the environment and suggested that the
sensory organes evolved to adapt to the incoming signals.


But what is an incoming signal? This question must certainly depends again
on the animals body, its locomotion, its speed, body shape. And here we are to accept
the fact that what reaches central sensory neurons depends on how motor
neurons do make use of the very specific body, and this in turn depends on
the very shape of the body. Therefore it is
increasingly harder to defend the position of a pregiven world that is
represented within by the organism without taking into the shape and design
of the animal. The shape and design of the animal specifies the sensory
motor space of the animal and these are the aspects which an embodied
science of mind can not disregard.


We should recognize that simple explanation of sensory process as
adaptation for a better representation of the external world shows only the half of the
story and ignores the complexity which is may be most relevant or at least
important.  Such a view reduces the animal to an disembodied agent and
consequently to something which is not much different than a computer
program. In such a view the animal is simply expected to receive some
signals from the world that he has full access from the start on, process
them and possibly combine them with its interior states and generate a
behaviour.


The counter part of this view in Cognitive Science. Representationism (or
cognitivism). :



How does it translate into visual neuroscience, science of
perception. Would be interesting to talk about the bayesian approach of the
vision. Actually bayesian approach is a nice introduction to natural
stimulus usage. But is bayesian approach a representationist approach? yes
and no. It is based on the calculation of probilities of some variables yet
it does not claim that the brain works based on these representations.
Tothe contrary it explains how the brains decisions are subjects to the
statistical structure within the environment. Kaldi ki, her
representation'da kotu olacak diye bir sey yok. One can say and I dont see
any problem on saying that on the motor cortex the direction of the
movement is represented for example

\begin{figure}

\caption{In the big scale, Y-axis display the results of different
experiments, and x-axis the different statistics extracted. Within each
box, x-axis is the conditions and y-axis is the trials. The staircase black
line symbolically shows the block identity changes. That is each time there
is step in the black line another block is started to be recorded and the
same block continues until the end of the straigt line segment.}

Let's make a pause and illustrate this point. Imagine we are given the task
of predicting the success (whether it's in or not) of a basketball player's
shot and we are given necessary amounts of video material shot under
controlled conditions while players are aiming to the circle. The videos
are composed of frames which represents the time shortly before and shortly
after the moment where the ball leaves the hand of the basketball player. Given that we
have only pixel data, it is not surprising that we would like to find some
heuristics based on the time-series data and find the best parameter which
predicts best the trajectory of the ball. Our program would most probably
compute some estimation of the ball trajectory and arm angles of the
players in order to find the best match. How do humans solves this issue?

Bla bla tackled this issue directly. What they found that

Marr's book.


the information processing paradigm as adapatational paradigmin evolution
presupposes that the information is available to the organism. However I
think it would be much more relevant to take literally the term
information: formed inside.


the basketball example is great for illustrating the embodiment of the
perceptual decision. jose paper also is great
