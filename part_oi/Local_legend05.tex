\textbf{Magnitude of Facilitation Depends on Stimulus Coherence.}
\textbf{(A)} Cortical activation patterns evoked by coherent (left) and
incoherent (right) movie patches shown for 2 different experiments
(upper/lower row).  Averages were computed across the first 900 ms in
accord with the occurrence of long-range facilitation. Note that besides
differences in peak values, the spatial profiles of activity in response to
coherent conditions were enlarged; in particular cortical regions between
the two activation spots showed elevated activity levels.\textbf{(B)}
Summary across all experiments.
