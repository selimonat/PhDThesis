\textbf{Propagation Speed of Cortical Activity.} \textbf{(A)} Oscillatory
activity around two pixels separated by 1 mm along the medial-lateral axis
(\textit{gray} and \textit{black} dots in panel \textbf{B}). Oscillatory
activity was best described by a harmonic function with a period of
$\approx$160 ms (\textit{black} and \textit{gray} fitted curves).
\textbf{(B)} The phase of each pixel is shown topographically for both
grating conditions. \textbf{(C)}, Change of phase as a function of space
within circumscribed regions (see vertical and horizontal rectangles in
(B). The slope of the fitting line was $\approx$1.2 rad/mm.
