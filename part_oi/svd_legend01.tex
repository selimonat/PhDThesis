\textbf{Decomposition of Evoked Cortical Voltage-Sensitive Dye Responses to
Moving Gratings.} \textbf{(A)}, Time courses of spatio-temporal activity
patterns (top rows) and spatial averages (bottom traces) expressed as
fractional change in fluorescence relative to blank condition
($\Delta$F/F). Scale bar 1 mm. Here and in all other plots: \textit{green}
= responses to vertical grating, drifting rightwards in visual space;
\textit{blue} = horizontal grating, drifting downwards.  \textbf{(B)}, (Top
left corner) Singular values ranked in order of their contributions.
Components of significant contribution to variance are colored
(\textit{gray} area depicts significance level). The contribution of each
single SVD component to individual recording trials (n = 35) were computed,
their correlations across trials are represented as a matrix. Spatial and
temporal profiles of the first 6 significant SVD components (top row and
left column) were clustered according to their correlation (\textit{red}
and \textit{yellow}).
