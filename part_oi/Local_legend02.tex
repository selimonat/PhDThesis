\textbf{Impact of Coherent Context on Cortical Activation Patterns.}
Spatio-temporal activity patterns produced by locally presented natural
movies. Leftmost column schematically shows the corresponding stimulus
condition and the movie used (\textit{blue} and \textit{red}). Each single frame represents
the average activity within 100 ms of non-overlapping segments of recorded
data. Please note the differences in activity patterns between top and
bottom triplets of rows where two different movies were used. The
similarity between rows in a given triplet suggests that these differences
are specifically caused by the individual dynamics and content of the
movies. The column to the left of the colorbar shows the average activity
maps computed across the stimulus presentation period. Rightmost column
depicts pixels constituting highest 5\textsuperscript{th} percentile of the
entire activity distributions. Scale bar 1 mm.
