\textbf{Propagation of Activity across Stationary Orientation Maps.}
Spatio-temporal activity dynamics represented by tonic and oscillatory SVD
components (\textit{red}, \textit{yellow} panels, respectively). Icons at left sketch
stimulus conditions. Time after stimulus onset indicated on top. Each frame
represents average activity within 100 ms (\textit{red} panels) and 10 ms
(\textit{yellow} panels). Contour lines are drawn around
90\textsuperscript{th} percentiles of activity for the tonic components and
at zero crossings for the oscillatory components (multiple cycles of
propagation were averaged in order to increase the signal-to-noise ratio).
Colorbars depict activity levels, $\Delta$F/F. Note the difference of two
orders between the two scales.
