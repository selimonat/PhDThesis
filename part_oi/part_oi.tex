\section{Analysis of Optical Imaging Data} 

In this section I provide a detailed account of the general analysis
methods used throughout this Chapter. In order to not disturb the flow of
thought related to the scientific questions with highly technical issues, I
require the reader to refer to the Appendix (in \ref{app_oi}) at the end of
this thesis.
