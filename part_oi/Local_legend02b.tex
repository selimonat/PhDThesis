\textbf{Retinotopical Mapping.} Retinotopy across the imaged cortical
region was evaluated by hand mapping of RF locations (colored rectangles)
at various penetration sites (see corresponding colored dots in vascular
image). Parallel to image acquisition, multiunit activity was recorded at a
position (\textit{red} dot) in which the neurons' RF approximately fitted
the center of the upper stimulus (\textit{red} rectangle; \textit{black} dots mark
center of each movie patch).
